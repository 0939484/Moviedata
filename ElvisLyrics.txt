"Well, it's one for the money, two for the show"
"Three to get ready, now go, cat, go"
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
"Well, you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes"
"Well, you can knock me down, step in my face"
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you wanna do
"But uh-uh honey, lay off of them shoes"
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes
"Let's go, cat!"
"Ah, walk the dog"
"You can burn my house, steal my car"
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar
Do anything that you want to do
"But uh-uh, honey, lay off of my shoes"
"Well, you can do anything, but lay off of my blue suede shoes"
Rock it
Yeah!
"Three to get ready, now go, go, go"
"Well, you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes"
"Well it's blue, blue, blue suede shoes"
"Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, yeah"

The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumping and the joint began to swing
You shoulda heard those knocked out jailbirds sing
"Let's rock, everybody, let's rock"
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joey blowing on the slide trombone
"The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang"
The whole rhythm section was the Purple Gang
Number forty-seven said to number three
"""You the cutest jailbird I ever did see"
I sure would be delighted with your company
"Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me"""
"Rock, rock, rock"
Sad sack was sitting on a block of stone
Way over in the corner weeping all alone
"The warden said, ""Hey, buddy, don't you be no square"
"You can't find a partner, use a wooden chair"""
"Shifty Henry said to Bugs, ""For Heaven's sake"
"No one's looking, now's our chance to make a break"""
"Bugsy turned to Shifty and he said, ""Nix nix"
"I wanna stick around a while and get my kicks."""
Dancing to the Jailhouse Rock
If you want to be loved
"Baby, you've got to love me too"
"Oh yeah, 'cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair"
If you want to be kissed
"Well, you've got to kiss me too"
"Oh yeah, if you want to be kissed"
"Well, fair exchange bears no robbery"
And the whole world will know that it's true
"Understanding solves all problems, baby"
That's why I'm telling you
If you want to be hugged
"Well, you got to hug me, too"
"Oh yeah, if you want to be hugged"
"Well, you've got to hug me, too"
Yeah
"Well, if you know you can't take it"
"Baby, why try to give it?"
If you know you can't take it
"Then baby, why try to give it?"
'Cause I ain't for no one-sided love affair
"Wop-bom-a-loowah, belah-bam-boom"
"Tutti frutti, oh Rudy"
"I got a gal named Sue, she knows just what to do"
"She rock me to the east, she rock me to the west"
She's the gal that I love best
"I got a gal named Daisy, she almost drives me crazy"
"She knows how to love me, yes indeed"
"Boy, you don't know what she do to me"
Hit it!
"Well, tutti frutti, oh Rudy"
I've been travelling over mountains
Even through the valleys too
I've been travelling night and day
I've been running all the way
"Baby, trying to get to you"
Ever since I read your letter
Where you said you loved me true
When I read your loving letter
Then my heart began to sing
There were many miles between us
But they didn't mean a thing
"I just had to reach you, baby"
In spite of all that I've been through
I kept travelling night and day
I kept running all the way
Well if I had to do it over
That's exactly what I'd do
I would travel night and day
And I'd still run all the way
"Well, there's nothing that could hold me"
Or that could keep me away from you
When your loving letter told me
That you really loved me true
Lord above me knows I love you
It was He who brought me through
When my way was dark as night
He would shine His brightest light
When I was trying to get to you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
"And if you say goodbye, if you ever even try"
I'm gonna love you more and more every day
I'm gonna  love you more and more in every way
"And if you ever say goodbye, if you ever even try"
"I'm gonna  tell my mama, tell my papa too"
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna to do
"If you ever say goodbye, if you ever even try"
I'm gonna love you more and more in every way
"And if ever you say goodbye, if you ever even cry"
"I'm going to tell my mama, tell my papa too"
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna do
"I'll never let you go, little darling"
I'm so sorry 'cause I made you cry
"I'll never let you go, 'cause I love you"
So please don't ever say goodbye
The stars would tumble down beside me
The moon would hang its head and cry
My arms would never hold another baby doll
If we should ever say goodbye
"Well, I'll never let you go"
"Because I love you, pretty baby"
"I'm so sorry 'cause I made you cry, I made you cry"
"Yeah, I'll never let you go"
"'Cause I love you, little baby"
"Well, it's Saturday night and I just got paid"
"A fool about my money, don't try to save"
"My heart says go, go, have a time"
"'Cause it's Saturday night, babe, and I'm feeling' fine"
I'm gonna rock it up
I'm gonna rip it up
I'm gonna shake it up
Gonna ball it up
Have a ball tonight
"Well, I got me a date and I won't be late"
I picked her up in my '88'
Shag on down to the social hall
"When the music starts jumpin', I'll have a ball"
And ball tonight
Along about ten I'll be flying high
I'll walk on out into open sky
But I don't care if I spend my dough
'Cause tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul
And a ball tonight
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for
Gonna tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John
"He claim he got married, but he havin' lotsa fun"
"Oh baby, yeah baby"
"Whoo baby, havin' me some fun tonight"
"Well, long tall Sally she built for speed"
She got everything that Uncle John needs
"Ooh baby, havin' me some fun tonight"
"Well, I saw uncle John with bald-headed Sally"
He saw Aunt Mary comin' and he ducked back in the alley
"Well, long tall Sally she's built sweet(5233508)"
"Whoo baby, havin' me some fun tonight, go"
I'm gonna have some fun tonight
Have some fun tonight
Everything's alright
"Have some fun, have me some fun tonight"
"Baby, let me be your loving teddy bear"
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
"Oh, let me be (oh, let him be)"
Your teddy bear
I don't wanna to be a tiger
Because tigers play too rough
I don't wanna be a lion
'Cause lions ain't the kind you love enough
Just wanna be your teddy bear
"Baby, let me be around you every night"
Run your fingers through my hair
And cuddle me real tight
I just wanna be your teddy bear (whoo)
When you looked into my eyes
I stood there like I was hypnotized
You sent a feeling to my spine
A feelin' warm and smooth and fine
But all I could do was stand there paralyzed
"When we kissed, ooh what a thrill"
"You took my hand and, ooh baby, what a chill"
I felt like grabbing you real tight
Squeeze and squeeze with all my might
"Oh yeah lucky me, I'm singing every day, ooh"
"Ever since that day you came my way, ooh"
You made my life for me just one big happy game
"I'm gay every morning, at night I'm still the same"
"Well, do you remember that wonderful time"
You held my hand and swore that you'd be mine
"In front of preacher you said ""I do"""
I couldn't say a word for thinking of you
All I could do was stand there paralyzed
"Well child, do you remember that wonderful time"
When you held my hand and swore that you'd be mine
My baby's long and tall
She like a cannonball
"Say, every time she loves me"
"Lordy, you can hear me squall"
"She cried, ""Ooh-wee"
"I believe I'll change my mind"""
"She said, ""I'm so glad I'm living"""
"I cried, ""I'm so glad you're mine"""
My baby knows just how
To treat me right
Gives me plenty loving
"Morning, noon and night"
When my baby does
What she does to me
I climb the highest mountain
Dive in the deepest sea
My baby's lips are red
And sweet like wine
And when she kisses me
I get high every time
"Ready, set, go man go"
I got a gal that I love so
"I'm ready, ready ready ready"
"I'm ready, ready ready teddy"
I'm ready ready ready to rock'n'roll
Going down to the corner
Pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock'n'roll baby
She's the apple of my eye
Flat top cats and the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
"The joint is really jumping, the cats are going wild"
"The music really sends me, I dig that crazy style"
"The joint's really jumping, the cats are going wild"
"The music really sends me, dig that crazy style"
"Gonna kick off my shoes, roll up my faded jeans"
"Grab my rock'n'roll baby, pour on the steam"
"I shuffle to the left, shuffle to the right"
Gonna rock'n'roll till the early early light
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where those tree-tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleighbells in the snow
With every Christmas card I write
"""May your days be merry and bright"
"And may all your Christmases be white"""
I-I-I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
"May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright"
And may all your Christmases be white
Whether I'm riding down a highway
Or walking down a street
"It makes no difference, baby"
I'm gonna love you just as mean
'Cause holding your little hand
Makes me feel so very nice
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you
Whether we're standing on a doorstep
Or sitting at a park
Or strolling down a shady lane
Or dancing in the dark
"Well, I can take you in my arms"
And look into your pretty eyes
Give me a cave up in the mountains
Or a shack down by the sea
"And I will be in heaven, honey"
If you are there with me
"Well, kiss your pretty lips"
See the love light in your eyes
"Baby, I'd live deep in the jungle"
And sleep up in a tree
And let the rest of the world go by
If you were there with me
"Well, I could love you all the time"
"Baby, the jungle would be fine"
I've had nothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
There's no hope for tomorrow
How's the world treating you?
Every sweet thing that mattered
Has been broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you're away
"And I'm asking you, darling"
How do you think I feel?
"Well, I know your love's not real"
The girl I'm mad about
Is just a gadabout
How do you think we stand?
"Well, I know you've made your plans"
But you've included three
And that's too much for me
I won't be true again
I know that I can't win
So why should I pretend
That you still love me?
"Well, how do you think we stand?"
I know you've made your plans
Another's pretty face
Has put me out of place
And you've included three
I am just a lonesome cowboy
And I'm travelling all alone
I ain't even got a nickel
To call my baby on the phone
Just beyond the mountain lies a city
And I hear it calling me
"Saddle up and ride, you lonesome cowboy"
Here is where you'll find your destiny (destiny)
In my dreams the lights shine bright and pretty
Near to me and yet so far
Will I always be a lonesome cowboy
Am I only reaching for a star?
"(For a star, for a star, for a star)"
"Ride, ride, ride"
"(Ride along cowboy) Cowboy, cowboy"
"(Sing) Sing, sing, sing"
"(Sing a song cowboy) Cowboy, cowboy"
Will I ever leave this lonesome valley
Really see the lights that shine (shine)
Got to find what lies beyond the mountain
Got to rope and tie that dream of mine
"(Dream of mine, dream of mine, that dream of mine)"
"If you don't call me, baby"
Then I'm never coming home
Then I ain't ever coming home
You're so young and beautiful
And I love you so
"Your lips so red, your eyes that shine"
Shame the stars that glow
So fill these lonely arms of mine
And kiss me tenderly
Then you'll be forever young
And beautiful to me
You're everything I love
"Your angel smile, your gentle touch"
Are all I'm dreaming of
"Oh, take this heart I offer you"
And never set me free
Don't leave me now (don't leave me now)
Now that I need you (ooh)
How blue and lonely I'd be
If you should say we're through (don't say we're through)
Don't break my heart (don't break my heart)
This heart that loves you (ooh)
There'd just be nothing for me
If you should leave me now (don't leave me now)
What good is dreaming
If I must dream all alone by myself
"Without you, darling (darling)"
My arms would gather dust
Like a book on the shelf
Come to these arms (come to these arms)
These arms that need you (ooh)
Don't close your eyes to my plea
Don't you leave me now (don't you leave me now)
I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill when I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
It lingered until my dreams came true
The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be
"Though we're apart, you're part of me still"
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill
"Suntanned, windblown"
Honeymooners at last alone
Feeling far above par
"Oh, how lucky we are"
While I give to you and you give to me
"True love, true love"
"So, on and on it will always be"
For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothing to do
But to give to you and to give to me
Love forever true
I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents for the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light leads
"I'll be home for Christmas, oh yes"
If only in my dreams
(I'll be home for Christmas)
I'll have a blue Christmas without you
"(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)"
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
"(Ahh, ahh)"
"Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me"
(Ooh)
And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue memories start callin'
"You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white"
"But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas"
"(Ooh, ah ooh)"
(Santa bring my baby back to me)
I don't need a lot of presents
To make my Christmas bright
I just need my baby's arms
Wound around me tight
"Oh Santa, hear my plea"
"Santa, bring my baby back to me"
The Christmas tree is ready
The candles all aglow
But with my baby far away
What good is mistletoe
Santa bring my baby back to me
Please make these reindeer hurry
Well their time is drawing near
It sure won't seem like Christmas
Until my baby's here
Fill my sock with candy
And a bright and shiny toy
You wanna make me happy
And fill my heart with joy
"Then Santa, hear my plea"
I need you so (I need you so)
To keep me happy
If I can't have you
I cannot go on (I can't go on)
I need your arms (I need your arms)
Around me tightly
"Yes, I miss them nightly"
When you're not at home (you're not at home)
When the day is done
I miss you so
I lie and wait
To hear you knock upon the door (knock upon the door)
When you leave me (when you leave me)
I try not to worry
"Come back in a hurry (please, please come back)"
'Cause I need you so (I need you so)
You know I can be found
Sitting home all alone
If you can't come around
At least please telephone
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true
"Baby, if I made you mad"
For something I might have said
"Please, let's forget the past"
The future looks bright ahead
I don't want no other love
"Baby, it's just you I'm thinking of"
Don't stop thinking of me
Don't make me feel this way
C'mon over here and love me
You know what I want you to say
Why should we be apart?
"I really love you, baby, cross my heart"
Let's walk up to the preacher
"And let us say ""I do"""
Then you'll know you'll have me
And I'll know that I'll have you
If you find your sweetheart
In the arms of a friend
That's when your heartaches begin
When dreams of a lifetime
Must come to an end
Love is a thing
You never can share
If you bring a friend
Into your love affair
That's the end of your sweetheart
That's the end of your friend
In the arms of your best friend
"Brother, that's- that's when your heartaches begin"
"O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie"
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by
"Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light"
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight
"For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above"
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of wondering love
"O morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth"
And praises sing to God the king and peace to men on earth
"Silent night, holy night"
"All is calm, all is bright"
'Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glorious strains from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia
Christ the Saviour is born
When I walk through that door
Baby be polite
You're gonna make me sore
If you don't greet me right
"Don't you ever kiss me once, kiss me twice"
Treat me nice
I know that you've been told
It's not fair to tease
So if you come on cold
I'm really gonna freeze
If you don't want me to be cold as ice
Make me feel at home
If you really care
Scratch my back and run your pretty
Fingers through my hair
You know I'll be your slave
If you ask me to
But if you don't behave
I'll walk right out on you
If you want my love then take my advice
If you really want my love then treat me nice
Let the stars fade and fall
And I won't care at all
As long as I have you
Every kiss brings a thrill
And I know that it will
Let's think of the future
Forget the past
You're not my first love
But you're my last
Take the love that I bring
Then I'll have everything
"As long, as long as I have you"
"Precious Lord, take my hand"
"Lead me on, let me stand"
"I'm tired, I'm weak, I'm lone"
"Through the storm, through the night"
Lead me on to the light
"Take my hand, precious Lord, lead me home"
When my way grows drear (precious Lord)
"Precious Lord, linger near (precious Lord)"
When my light is almost gone
"Hear my cry, hear my call"
Hold my hand lest I fall
When the darkness appears
And the night draws near
And the day is past and gone
At the river I stand
"Guide my feet, hold my hand"
"Precious Lord, take my hand (precious Lord)"
"Lead me on, let me stand (precious Lord)"
(Lead me home)
"Well, a hard headed woman"
A soft hearted man
Been the cause of trouble
Ever since the world began
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
A hard headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man
Now Adam told to Eve
"""Listen here to me"
Don't you let me catch you
"Messing round that apple tree"""
Samson told Delilah
Loud and clear
"""Keep your cotton picking fingers"
"Out my curly hair"""
I heard about a king
Who was doin' swell
Till he started playing
With that evil Jezebel
I got a woman
A head like a rock
If she ever went away
I'd cry around the clock
"They call me poor boy, poor boy, poor boy"
But I ain't lonesome and I ain't blue
'Cause I could never be a poor boy
As long as I've got a dolly like you
"Ain't got a crust, ain't got a cent"
"Can't buy a jug, can't pay the rent"
I got a heart full of dreams and a lot of memories
And that's enough for me
"Can't buy a house, can't buy a lot"
"Ain't got a bean, ain't got a pot"
But what I got is a heart full of love and memories
I've got a dolly like you
"Don't have a pig, don't have a cow"
I don't have a horse to pull a plow
I've got a dolly like
The chimes of time ring out the news
Another day is through
Someone slipped and fell
Was that someone you?
You may have longed for added strength
Your courage to renew
Do not be disheartened
For I have news for you
It is no secret what God can do
"What He's done for others, He'll do for you"
"With arms wide open, He'll pardon you"
There is no night for in His light
You'll never walk alone
Always feel at home
Wherever you may go
There is no power can conquer you
While God is on your side
Take Him at His promise
Don't run away and hide
If you're looking for trouble
You came to the right place
Just look right in my face
I was born standing up
And talking back
My daddy was a green-eyed mountain jack
Because I'm evil
My middle name is misery
Well I'm evil
So don't you mess around with me
I've never looked for trouble
But I've never ran
I don't take no orders
From no kind of man
I'm only made out
"Of flesh, blood and bone"
But if you're gonna start a rumble
Don't you try it on alone
"I'm evil, evil, evil as can be"
So don't mess around don't mess around don't mess around with me
"I'm evil, I'm evil"
"Evil, evil"
"So don't mess around, don't mess around with me"
"I'm evil, I tell you I'm evil"
So don't mess around with me
"Well get out of that bed, wash your face and hands"
"Get out of that bed, wash your face and hands"
"Well get in that kitchen, make some noise with your pots and pans"
I believe it to my soul you're the devil in nylon hose
For the harder I work the faster my money goes
"Well I said shake, rattle and roll"
I said shake rattle and roll
"I said shake, rattle and roll"
Well you won't do right to save your doggone soul
(Shake rattle and roll)
I'm like a one-eyed cat peeping in a seafood store
Well I can look at you tell you ain't a child no more
"The way you wear those dresses, the sun comes shinin' through"
"I can't believe my eyes, all that mess belongs to you"
(Shake it!)
"I went over the hill, way down underneath"
"You make me roll my eyes, and then you make me grit my teeth"
"Blue moon, blue moon, blue moon"
Keep shining bright
"Blue moon, keep on shining bright"
You're gonna bring me back my baby tonight
"Blue moon, keep shining bright"
"I said blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shining"
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
"Well, it was on one moonlight night"
Stars shining bright
Wish blown high
Love said goodbye
"Blue moon of Kentucky, keep on shining"
"Well, I said blue moon of Kentucky, just keep on shining"
"Well, you're right, I'm left, she's gone"
"You're right, and I'm left all alone"
"Well, you tried to tell me so"
But how was I to know
That she was not the one for me?
You told me all along
"You're right, our love was so wrong"
But now I changed my mind
Because she broke the ties that bind
And I know that she never cared for me
"Well, I thought I knew just what she'd do"
I guess I'm not so smart
"Oh, you tried to tell me along"
She'd only break my heart
"I'm left, you're right, she's gone"
"Well, she's gone I know not where"
But now I just don't care
For now I'm falling for you
If you'll forgive me now
I'll make it up somehow
So happy we will be
In a home just for three
And I'll soon forget her
Now I know
You tried to tell me all along
"Well, she's gone, I know not where"
For now I've fallen for you
You're a Heartbreaker
You're a love faker
A Heartbreaker playing with fire
You're a tear snatcher
You're a quarrel patcher
But you can't break my heart anymore
For I just found someone else
Who's sure to take your place
Someone I can always trust
And to fill this empty space
You're a smooth talker
You're a real cool walker
But now you have talked out of turn
You're a high stepper
You're a eye-catcher
But you won't catch my glances any more
"Well, down in New Orleans at the Golden Goose"
I grabbed a green-eyed dolly that was on the loose
"Well, I dig that music, well she said, ""Me too"""
"I said, ""Pretty baby come on and let's do"""
The Dixieland rock (Dixieland rock)
"Well, the Dixieland rock (Dixieland rock)"
"Let your hair down Sugar, shake it free"
And do the Dixieland rock with me
With the blue light shining on her swinging hips
She got the drummer so nervous that he lost his sticks
The cornet player hit a note that's flat
The trombone hit him while the poor cat sat
To the Dixieland rock (Dixieland rock)
I was all pooped out and when the clock struck four
"But she said, no daddy can't leave the floor"
She wore a clinging dress that fit so tight
She couldn't sit down so we danced all night
"Let your hair dance Sugar, shake it free"
"(Dixieland, Dixieland)"
(Dixieland rock with me)
I'll go on loving you (loving you)
Don't ask me why (don't ask me why)
Don't know what else to do
Don't ask me why
How sad my heart would be (heart would be)
If you should go (if you should go)
Though you're not good for me
I want you so
It's not the kind
Of love I dream about
But it's the kind
That I can't live without
You're all I'm longing for (longing for)
Don't say goodbye (don't say goodbye)
I need you more and more
"Lover doll, oh lover doll (lover doll)"
"Lover doll, lover doll (lover doll)"
You're the cutest lover doll
That I ever did ever see
Let me tell you lover doll
"You were meant, just meant for me"
On the first time that I saw you
How I fell for your cuddly charms
"Lover doll, I'm crazy for you"
Let me rock you in my arms
I'm so glad I found you
Never thought dollies came full grown
I'm gonna tie a ribbon around you
Wrap you up and take you home
I would never treat you badly
Like a cast away broken toy
"Lover doll, I love you madly"
Let me be your lover boy
"Lover doll, lover doll (Lover doll, lover doll)"
Crawfish (crawfish)
Well I went to the bayou just last night
There was no moon but the stars were bright
Put a big long hook on a big long pole
And I pulled Mr. Crawfish out of his hole
"See I got him, see the size"
Stripped and cleaned before your eyes
"Sweet meat, look"
Fresh and ready to cook
Now take Mr. Crawfish in your hand
He's gonna look good in your frying pan
If you fry him crisp or you boil him right
He'll be sweeter than sugar when you take a bite
Never know how much I love you
Never knew how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right
Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
"He said 'Julie, baby, you're my flame"
Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm on fire
"Fever, yeah, I burn forsooth"
Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
"She said 'Daddy-o, don't you dare"
He give me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
"Fever, I'm his misses"
"Oh daddy, won't you treat him right'"
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give you fever when we kiss you
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
"(Young dreams of love, young dreams of love)"
"Young dreams (Young dreams, young dreams)"
My heart is filled with young dreams (dreams)
And I'm longing to
Share them all with you
"In my eyes, (my eyes, my eyes)"
"Oh, can't you see in my eyes (in eyes)"
That you're the only one who
Can make my young dreams come true
I have young arms
That want to hold you (hold you)
Hold you oh so tight
I have young lips (lips)
That want to kiss you (kiss you)
Kiss you morning noon and night
"Take my hand (my hand, my hand)"
"Oh darling, take my hand (take hand)"
And let me make you a part
Of all my young dreams of love
That wanna hold you (hold you)
Hold you good and tight
I have young lips
That wanna kiss you (kiss you)
"Oh darling, take my hand, oh (take hand)"
And let me make you a part (let me make you a part)
A part of all of my young dreams of love

"Farewell, Royal High School"
We'll remember you
Dear alma mater
"We're steadfast, loyal, and true"
As we go onward
In the lives we lead
Your light will guide us
Your motto is our creed
We will look back fondly
At your ivy walls
Recalling precious moments
Within your hallowed halls
"Oh oh, I love you so"
"Uh uh, can't let you go"
"Ooh ooh, don't tell me no"
I need your love tonight
"Oh gee, the way you kiss"
"Sweetie, too good to miss"
"Wow-whee, want more of this"
I've been waiting just for tonight
To do some lovin' and hold you tight
Don't tell me baby you gotta go
I got the hi-fi high and the lights down low
"Hey now, hear what I say"
"Oh wow, you better stay"
"Pow pow, don't run away"
"I need your love tonight, yeah"
"Well, I woke up this morning"
And I looked out the door
I can tell that old milk cow
By the way she lowed
"Hold it fellows, that don't move me"
"Let's get real, real gone for a change"
I can tell that that old milk cow
I can tell the way she lowed
"Well, if you've seen my milk cow"
Please ride her on home
I ain't had no milk or butter
Since that cow's been gone
"Well, I tried to treat you right"
Day by day
Get out your little prayer book
Get down on your knees and pray
For you're gonna need
You're gonna need
Your loving daddy's help someday
"Well, then you're gonna be sorry"
For treating me this way
"Oh, let's milk it!"
"Well, believe me, don't that sun"
Look good going down?
"Well, don't that old moon look lonesome"
When your baby's not around
"Well, I tried everything to"
Get along with you
I'm gonna tell you what I'm going do
I'm gonna quit my crying
I'm gonna leave you alone
If you don't believe I'm leaving
You can count the days I'm gone
I'm gonna leave
You're gonna need your
Loving daddy's help someday
"Well, you're gonna be sorry"
You treated me this way
"Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby baby"
"Baby, baby baby, b-b-b-b-b-b baby baby, baby"
Baby baby baby
"Come back, baby, I wanna play house with you"
"Well, you may go to college"
You may go to school
You may have a pink Cadillac
But don't you be nobody's fool
Now baby
"Come back, baby, come"
"Come back, baby"
I wanna play house with you
Now listen and I'll tell you baby
What I'm talking about
"Come on back to me, little girl"
So we can play some house
"Oh let's play house, baby"
"Now this is one thing, baby"
That I want you to know
Come on back and let's play a little house
And we can act like we did before
"Well, baby"
Hit it
"Now listen to me, baby"
Try to understand
"I'd rather see you dead, little girl"
Than to be with another man
"Oh, baby baby baby"
Baby baby baby b-b-b-b-b-b baby baby baby
Hold me tight
The moon is so bright
Tonight is so right for love
Now's the time
To say you're the one
One by one the stars appear
They twinkle in your eyes
Who'd believe that we'd be here
So near to paradise
This could be the kiss
To unlock heaven's door
That magic hour of bliss
That we both waited for
I love you more and more
"Oh, we could fly right up to the sky"
The things we've been dreaming of
And how real they would seem
A midsummer night's dream
Can't you see that tonight's so right for love
The moon's so bright
Holy smoke
And sakes alive!
I never thought this could happen to me
"Uh huh, yeah"
I got stung by a sweet honey bee
"Oh, what a feeling come over me"
It started in my eyes
Crept up to my head
Flew to my heart
Till I was stung dead
"I'm done, uh-uh"
I got stung
She had all that I wanted and more
And I've seen honey bees before
She started buzzing in my ear
Buzzing in my brain
Got stung all over
But I feel no pain
Now don't think I'm complaining
I'm mighty pleased we met
Because you give me just one little peck
On the back of my neck
"And I break out in a cold, cold sweat"
If I live to a hundred and two
I won't let nobody sting me but you
I'll be buzzing around your hive
Every day at five
And I'm never going to leave once I arrive
Because I'm done
"Uh-uh, I got stung"
What's she really like
The girl that you see me with
The one I'm so dreamy with
"Well, let me tell you she's wonderful"
She's marvelous and she's mine
"Talk about her lips, her lips are so thrillable"
I can't describe her kiss in words of one syllable
She's even more than adorable
And what's moreable she's all mine
You're asking if she loves me
"Well, you don't know the half"
You're wondering if she'll leave me
"Ha, ha, ha, don't make me laugh"
The girl I go on about
The one I'm so gone about
"All I can say, she's wonderful"
Adorable and she's mine
Marvelous and she's mine
Wonderful and she's mine
Can't you see I love you
Please don't break my heart in two
That's not hard to do
'Cause I don't have a wooden heart
And if you say goodbye
Then I know that I would cry
Maybe I would die
There's no strings upon this love of mine
It was always you from the start
"Treat me nice, treat me good"
Treat me like you really should
'Cause I'm not made of wood
And I don't have a wooden heart
"Muss i denn, muss i denn"
Zum Stadtele hinaus
Stadtele hinaus
"Und du, mein Schatz, bleibst hier?"
"Sei mir gut, sei mir gut"
Sei mir wie du wirklich sollst
Wie du wirklich sollst
I have wished for the wealth
Of a great millionaire
I have reached for a bright star above
But the thrill of it all
To me seems so small
When compared to the thrill of your love
I'd rather give everything
That I own in this world
Than to be all alone and unloved
For no earthly price and no sacrifice
Is too much to give for your love
I don't worry
Whenever skies are gray above
Got a pocketful of rainbows
Got a heart full of love
Mister Heartache
I've found a way to make him leave
Got a star up in my sleeve
Kiss me extra tender
Hold me extra tight
'Cause I'm saving your sweetness
"For a lonely night, aye"
"Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye"
No more teardrops
Now that I've found a love so true
I got a pocketful of rainbows
Got an armful of you
No more heartaches
And an armful of you
Rainbows
Step in these arms
Where you belong
"It feels so right, so right"
How can it be wrong?
There's something in the way you kiss
That makes me wanna hold you tight
I know that nothing can be wrong
"That feels so right, oh"
Each time we touch
You thrill me so
"It means so much, so much"
"I can't let you go, yeah"
This isn't only for tonight
We're gonna love our whole life through
"'Cause baby, if it feels so right"
We're gonna love our whole life long
One night with you
Is what I'm now praying for
The things that we two could plan
Would make my dreams come true
Just call my name
And I'll be right by your side
I want your sweet helping hand
My love's too strong to hide
"Always lived, very quiet life"
I have never did no wrong
Now I know that life without you
Has been too lonely too long
You gave me love to enjoy
Like a bright shiny toy to a baby
No matter what you would do
I depended on you like a baby
One thing I know I love you
"Yes, I loved you like a baby"
It was a fool's heart you took
And I fell 'cause you look like a baby
"To lovers' ways, I was blind"
'Cause I just had a mind like a baby
You're just a flirt
And I had to be hurt just like a baby
"(Oh, oh, oh, oh)"
"I need you so, I need you so"
The day I found how you lied
Then I broke down and cried like a baby
"Well, it was then I could see"
You were playing with me like a baby
"Well, you can bet that someday"
I'll forget just like a baby
"Hey baby, I ain't asking much of you"
"No no no no no no no no baby, I ain't asking much of you"
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk of love will do
Don't be a stingy little mama
You're 'bout to starve me half to death
Now you can spare a kiss or two and
"Still have plenty left, no no no"
"Baby, I ain't asking much of you"
You're just a natural born beehive
Filled with honey to the top
"But I ain't greedy, baby"
"All I want is all you got, no no no"
I ain't asking much of you
I got a wishbone in my pocket
I got a rabbit foot around my wrist
You know I'd have all of the things my lucky charms could bring
If you give me just a one sweet kiss
Oh no no no no no no no no
"Just a big a hunk o' hunk o' hunk o' love will do, that's right"
"Just a big a big a big a hunk o' love will do, that's right"
Just a big a big a big a hunk o' love
I don't want my heart to be broken
'Cause it's the only one I've got
"So darling, please be careful"
You know I care a lot
"Darling, please don't break my heart"
I beg of you
I don't want no tears a-falling
You know I hate to cry
But that's what's bound to happen
If you would say goodbye
"Darling, please don't say goodbye"
Hold my hand and promise
That you'll always love me true
Make me know you'll love me
"The same way I love you, little girl"
You got me at your mercy
Now that I'm in love with you
So please don't take advantage
Because you know my love is true
"Darling, please please love me too"
'Cause you know my love is true
"Well, so long"
"Oh, how I hate to see you go"
"Yes, so long"
Well the way that I will miss you
I guess you'll never know
We've been together so long
To have to separate this way
"Well, I'm gonna let you go ahead on, baby"
But let you come back home someday
"Play the blues boys, play the blues"
One more time
You said you once had loved me
But now I guess you've changed your mind
Why don't you reconsider baby
Give yourself just a little more time
I've been yearnin' for a little romance
I want to know when you're gonna give me a chance
"Love me honey, tell me you're mine"
Doncha' think it's time
I've been yearning for a sweet embrace
Rub my hair till I'm a total disgrace
Kiss me honey make me feel so fine
I don't wanna walk without you
Walking right by my side
It hurts me to see you talkin'
With the other guy
I get so warm when you touch my cheek
You thrill me so much that I can hardly speak
"Love me honey, when you feel so fine"
To any other guy
"Kiss me honey, make me feel so fine"
I gave my heart
I gave my love
"Oh ho, my darling"
I am true
Doing the best
The best I can (the best I can)
But it's not good
Enough for you
I tried so hard
So hard to please
What more can I do
Enough for you (for you)
You know I was the kind who'd run
Any time you'd call
I guess I was the only one
Who didn't mind at all
I'll be a dreamer
I'll be a fool
My whole life through
Do you or don't you love me
Such an easy question
Why can't I get an answer
"Tell me, will you or won't you need me"
All you do is give a sigh
And beat around the bush
Can it be that you're too shy
To give yourself a little old push
Can you or can't you tell me yes
It's such an easy question
"Listen, little lady"
You're steppin' out of line
What's your hurry baby
You got a lot of time
That's not love you feel
It's only make believe
"Watch out, you'll break the heart"
You're wearing on you sleeve
Cheating with your kisses
You think you know it all
Old worry gonna get you
You're riding for a fall
Better slow it down
I see a danger sign
Cause the way you're steppin' around
Every time you kiss me
I'm still not certain that you love me
Every time you hold me
I'm still not certain that you care
Though you keep on saying
"You really, really, really love me"
Do you speak the same words
To someone else when I'm not there
Suspicion torments my heart
Suspicion keeps us apart
Suspicion why torture me
Every time you call me
And tell me we should meet tomorrow
I can't help but think that
You're meeting someone else tonight
Why should our romance just
Keep on causing me such sorrow?
Why am I so doubtful
Whenever you're out of sight?
"Darling, if you love me"
I beg you wait a little longer
Wait until I drive all
These foolish fears out of my mind
How I hope and pray that
Our love will keep on growing stronger
Maybe I'm suspicious
Cause true love is so hard to find
"It's a sin, my darling, how I love you"
Because I know our love could never be
It's a sin to keep this memory of you
When silence proves that you've forgotten me
The dreams I built for us has tumbled
Each promise broken like my heart
So much in love and yet so far apart
I'm sure you're happy with another
Who shares the love I could not win
Why pretend that I can live without you
When deep inside I know that it's a sin
"Your lips, your eyes, your soft sweet sights"
I feel that I've known you forever
"Your style, your touch, you're just too much"
I know that this never happened to me
Don't have to see anymore than I see
"Your face so rare, beyond compare"
And ever and ever
You may ask me how I know
My Lord is real (My Lord is real)
You may doubt the things I say
And doubt the way I feel (the way I feel)
But I know he's real today
He'll always be (He'll always be)
I can feel his hand in mine
I will never walk alone
He holds my hand (He holds my hand)
He will guide each step I take
And if I fall I know he'll understand
Till the day he tells me why
He loves me so (he loves me so)
That's all I need to know
"I'm gonna walk, walk them golden stairs"
Cause I know my Jesus answers all my prayers
"Well, well I know when he calls me to my home on high"
"I'll walk them golden stairs when I die, when I die"
Oh lord you know I can hardly wait
To reach that suite by by by and by
And now I see those pearly gates
"Well, well, well"
When Jesus says to me well done
And all my cares are laid by
"I'll lay down my soul, my battles are won"
I'll walk them golden stairs when I die when I die
In my father's house are many mansions
If it were not true he would have told me so
He has gone away to live in that bright city
He's preparing me a mansion there I know
Jesus died upon the cross to bear my sorrow
Freely died that souls like you might have new life
But I know that soon there'll come a bright tomorrow
When the world will all be free from sin and strife
"(Do not shun the savior's love, from up in glory)"
(Or you won't be there to sing the gospel story)
If you're true then to this land you'll surely go
"Yes, I'm gonna walk that milky white way"
Oh Lord some of these days
"Well, I'm gonna walk that milky white way"
Some of these days well well well well
I'm gonna walk up and take my stand
Gonna join that Christian band
I'm gonna walk on that milky white way
"Oh Lord, some of these days"
"I'm gonna tell my mother howdy, howdy"
Howdy when I get home
"Yes, I'm gonna tell my mother howdy"
When I get home well well well well
I'm gonna shake my mother's hand
I will shake her hands that day
That's when we walk on the milky white way
On some of these days
I'm gonna meet God the father and God the son
"Yes, I'm gonna meet God the father and God the son"
Well well well well
I'm gonna sit down and tell Him my troubles
About the world that I just came from
"Oh Lord, on some of these days"
Starting today
I'm teaching my heart
Not to ache anymore
Just because we're apart
No more will I dream
Of your sweet loving ways
Going to learn to forget you
And when memories haunt me
And the tears start to flow
I'll just think of the sorrow
You caused me to know
No more in the past
To return will I pray
Going to live for tomorrow
One thought of you
My heart begins churning
I feel return
To a fountain of love
My lips and eyes
They ache to be near you
To hold you here
In my fountain of love
Never be blue
Should your world start sinking
Just come and drink
From my fountain of love
We'll build a new world off
On a high mountain
We'll live
On our fountain of love
Known only to him are the great hidden secrets
I'll fear not the darkness when my flame shall dim
I know not what the future holds
But I know who holds the future
It's a secret known only to Him
In this world of fear and doubt
On my knees I ask the question
"Why a lonely, heavy cross I must bear"
Then he tells me in my prayer
It's because I am trustworthy
He gives me strength far more than my share
"Take off your shoes, put down your hair"
"Turn on the music, and we'll get somewhere"
"Dance, dance, dance, till you toes get tan"
We're gonna to have us a ball on the beach
A-slicing sand
"Hug me a heap, swing me a lot"
We got a lot of ocean if it gets too hot
"O-o-o, o-o-o, baby, take my hand"
We'll have some real rocking fun in the sun
"Come baby, come, let's dig some holes"
You'll find it's heaven with sand on your soles
"Slice through to the left, slice to the right"
"Slice down the middle, baby, hold me tight"
"O-o-o wee, o-o-o, baby, hold my hand"
Slicing sand
Ooo yeah
Hawaiian sunset peeping from the sea
Smiles and says Aloha to his sweetheart Hawaii
The drowsy islands slumber one by one
Close their sleepy eyelids say goodnight to the sun
Then Hawaii like millions of times before
Blossoms in her lover's arms once more
Too soon the sunrise will wake her from her sleep
"So until tomorrow, sleep Hawaii sleep"
I'm a poor Hawaiian beach boy
A long way from the beach
Cause someone shoved his face against my hand
Now I'm a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
I'm in the can
I was minding my own business
Drinking daddy's juice
I swear I'll never touch that stuff again
Just like a pig before he gave his all at the lu'au
I'm in the pen
Got those beach boy blues
Don't the time go slow
Lonely beach boy blues
Only 30 days and 90 years to go
I want a taste of honey
From my wahine's lips
I want to be her ever loving man
But I'm a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
Jericho Jericho
And the walls come tumbling down
God knows that
Good morning sister Mary
Good morning brother John
Well I wanna stop and talk with you
Wanna tell you how I come along
I know you've heard about Joshua
He was the son of Nun
He never stopped his work until
Until the work was done
You may talk about your men of Gideon
You may brag about your men of Saul
There's none like good old Joshua
At the battle of Jericho
Up to the walls of Jericho
He marched with spear in hand
"Go blow them ram horns, Joshua cried"
Cause the battle is in my hands
You may brag about your king of Saul
There none like Joshua
"They tell me, great God that Joshua's spear"
Was well nigh twelve feet long
And upon his hip was a double edged sword
And his mouth was a gospel horn
Yet bold and brave he stood
Salvation in his hand
Go blow them ram horns Joshua cried
Cause the devil can't do you no harm
Then the lamb ram sheep horns began to blow
The trumpets began to sound
Old Joshua shouted glory
And the walls came tumbling down
"Down, down, down, down, down"
Tumbling down
My Jesus knows when I am lonely
"He knows each pain, he sees each tear"
He understands each lonely heartache
He understands because he cares
My Jesus knows just what I need
Oh yes! He knows just what I need
He satisfies and every need supplies
"Yes, he knows just what I need"
This is the moment
I've waited for
I can hear my heart singing
Soon bells will be ringing
Ring Ring Ring
Of sweet Aloha
I will love you longer than forever
Promise me that you will leave me never
Here and now dear
All my love
I vow dear
Ua sila
Pa‘a ‘ia me ‘oe
Ko aloha makamae e ipo
Ka'u ia e lei a‘e nei la
Now that we are one
Clouds won't hide the sun
Blue skies of Hawaii smile
"On this, our wedding day"
I do love you with all my heart
Why don't you swing down sweet chariot
Stop and let me ride
Swing down chariot
"Rock me lord, rock me lord"
Calm and easy
Well I got a home on the other side
"Well, well, well, well, well, well"
Ezekiel went down in the middle of a field
He saw an angel working on a chariot wheel
Wasn't so particular 'bout the chariot wheel
Just wanted to see how a chariot feel
Ezekiel went down and he got on board
Chariot went a bumping on down the road
Zeke wasn't so particular 'bout the bumping of the road
Just wanted to lay down his heavy load
Well I got a father in the promised land
Ain't no more stopping till I shake his hand
I got a home on the other side
I'm satisfied with just a cottage below
A little silver and a little gold
But in that city where the ransomed will shine
I want a gold one that's silver lined
I've got a mansion just over the hilltop
In that bright land where we'll never grow old
And some day yonder we will never more wander
But walk on streets that are purest gold
Don't think me poor or deserted or lonely
I'm not discouraged I'm heaven bound
I'm but a pilgrim in search of the city
"I want a mansion, a harp and a crown"
Well it's so very hard to have
To leave the one you love
And you get more lonely
With each passing day
It's so lonely just sitting
And dreaming of
That girl thousand miles away
"Yes, it's still lonely having"
Just her picture here with me
And I know I just can't stand it anymore
I'm going to leave right now
And go back where I ought to be
Going home to the girl that I adore
"Well, every time I hear"
Her sweet voice on the telephone
Then I know I just can't stand it another day
I'm going to call right back
And tell her that I'm coming home and stay
Call her back and say I'm coming home and stay
If they say we were doing wrong
If they say we were out too long
"Well, you can say"
My arms were just too strong
"Put the blame, put the blame on me"
Felt so good when I held you tight
Couldn't stop when we kissed Goodnight
So if they tell us we don't heave the right
What I feel is deep inside
This is real and I won't hide
"Go ahead, use my name"
I'll be proud to take the blame
You just did what I did you do
You love me and I love you too
So if the way they talk can bother you
Take me to the fair
"Take me to the fair, don't know anywhere"
I would rather be
"Let's, go to the fair"
"We'll walk hand in hand, through Tomorrow Land"
Honey you and me
"I wanna see everything, do everything"
While we're doin' it all
I'll buy the peanuts and popcorn
We'll have us a ball
You can spend my pay
"Crush me in the crowds, I'll be in the clouds"
Honey I don't care
Take me there by sleigh
"Roller skate or bike, anyway you like"
But take me to the fair
When I was little my mama said to me
"""Someday you'll find a love, son, to last eternally"""
I want you with me everywhere I go
"(I want you with me, I want you with me)"
"No, please don't leave me, baby, I love you so"
"(I want you with me, baby, I want you with me)"
I'll be the ruler of this whole wide world
If you will only say that you'll be my girl
I want you with me in everything I do
"(I want you with me, I want you with me"
"I want you with me, I want you with me)"
"Well, you know I need you, baby, I'm in love with you"
"(I want you with me, baby, I need it)"
There is no mountain that I can't climb
"You find the mountain, child, and I will find the time"
"I want you with me, with me night and day"
"Well, you can make me happy, baby, don't you go away"
"(I want you with me, baby, one more time)"
I'll swim an ocean with a raging foam
If I know that you'll be there when I come back home
"I want you with me, you know I love you so"
"Well, I want you with me baby, I'll never ever let you go"
"(I want you with me, baby, oh)"
"Yeah, I want you with me"
I want you with me
"Well, I want you with me baby, I'll never let you go"
"I look at you and wham, I'm head over heels"
I guess that love is a banana peel
I feel so bad and yet I'm feeling so well
"I slipped, I stumbled, I fell"
"One crazy kiss and boom, I head for the skies"
I guess that love is like a cake of ice
You skate along but then you can never tell
I never thought I'd get tricked by your sweet talking lies
You got a bag of tricks
And when you got busy I got dazzled and dizzy
I fell like a ton of bricks
"My knees are weak, my head is spinning around"
I guess that love has turned me upside down
"Thought I'd get hurt, but gee, it's turning out swell"
Where do you come from?
Tell me who you are
Do you come from another world
Or from some distant star?
Are you what you seem?
Are you real
Are you standing there
Or is it just a dream?
Tell me more about yourself
Do you feel the way I feel?
Are you just a vision
Or are you really real?
Angel won't you say?
Tell me all that there is to know
And tell me that you'll stay
"Take away, the scent of flowers"
"Cover up, the sky of blue"
Close my ears to tender love songs
They remind me too much of you
Hide young lovers warm embraces
Keep stars and moonlight from my view
"Let me forget, there are such places"
Must I evermore be haunted?
"Day after day, my whole life through"
By the memory of each moment
That I spent alone with you
If these lovely things dont hurt you
Our love just wasn't meant to be
"But please come back to me, my darling"
"If they remind you, too much of me"
"I don't want to, I don't want to"
I don't want to let you know how much I want you
"Don't come near me, I don't trust you"
I don't trust the way you thrill me when I touch you
"I was happy free and easy, I could go around"
And do the things that please me
I don't want to get tied down with a girl like you
"I don't want to love you, but I do"
Oh I will never forget the first night we met
Was love I was searching for
"My heart beat faster and faster, oh so much faster"
Faster than it did before
Juntos estaremos
Siempre por siempre
Junto a mi corazo'n
Siempre estara's
"We'll be together, and love forever"
Nothing can change our destiny
"I knew the moment I kissed you, couldn't resist you"
Together we belong
And then I knew in that moment just what this glow meant
True love had come along
"We'll be together, ever and ever, close to my heart"
You'll always be
When a boy like me meets a girl like you
Then I must believe wishes come true
I just look at you and I touch your hand
And this ordinary world becomes a wonderland
There are many girls I have met before
But I pass them by because I knew
There would be this magic moment
One to last a lifetime through
Return to sender!
I gave a letter to the postman
He put it his sack
Bright in early next morning
He brought my letter back
(She wrote upon it)
Return to sender
Address unknown
No such number
No such zone
We had a quarrel
A lover's spat
"I write I'm sorry, but my letter keeps coming back"
So then I dropped it in the mailbox
And sent it special D
It came right back to me
No such person
This time I'm gonna take it myself
And put it right in her hand
And if it comes back the very next day
Then I'll understand
(The writing on it)
It's now or never
Come hold me tight
"Kiss me, my darling"
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
My love won't wait
When I first saw you
With your smile so tender
My heart was captured
My soul surrendered
I'd spend a lifetime
Waiting for the right time
Now that you're near
The time is here at last
Just like a willow
We would cry an ocean
If we lost true love
And sweet devotion
Your lips excite me
Let your arms invite me
For who knows when
We'll meet again this way
"I'm falling in love, tonight"
"Somehow, I know"
The beautiful world tonight
"Is sharing, it's glow"
When love let me down before
I said I was through
But I'm falling in love tonight
With you
Until you walked by
I laughed and played the game
"One last kiss, then goodbye"
And out went the flame
"But somehow, you've changed me dear"
"This time, it's true"
I'm falling in love tonight
You can shake an apple off an apple tree
"Shake-a, shake-a sugar, but you'll never shake me"
Uh-uh-uh
"No-sir-ee, uh, uh"
I'm going to stick like glue
"Stick, because I'm"
Stuck on you
I'm going to run my fingers thru your long black hair
Squeeze you tighter than a grizzly bear
"Yes-sir-ee, uh, uh"
"Hide in the kitchen, hide in the hall"
Ain't gonna do you no good at all
'Cause once I catch you and the kissing starts
A team of wild horses couldn't tear us apart
Try to take a tiger from his daddy's side
That's how love is going to keep us tied
"Oh yeah, uh, uh"
I'm gonna stick like glue
"I'm gonna stick like glue, yeah yeah"
Because I'm stuck on you
Get up in the morning feeling mighty weak
"A tossing and a turning well, I ain't had no sleep"
"Oh baby, what road's our love taking?"
To romance or heartbreaking
Won't you say which way you're going to go
"I got to know, got to know, got to know"
"Nine and nine make fourteen, four and four make nine"
The clock is striking thirteen I think I lost my mind
You know it's getting aggravating
How long can I keep waiting?
Tell me if you love me yes or no
"Oh, how much I need you"
Have pity on this heart of mine
"Well, if you need and want me too"
I'll be your one and only till the end of time
"Saw the fortune teller, had my fortune read"
"She sent me to the doctor, who sent me straight to bed"
He said I'm lonesome and I'm lovesick
I've got my mind on lipstick
Will you kiss away my cares and woe?
When we kiss my heart's on fire
Burning with a strange desire
"And I know, each time I kiss you"
That your heart's on fire too
"So, my darling, please surrender (surrender)"
All your love so warm and tender (surrender)
"Let me hold you in my arms, dear"
While the moon shines bright above
All the stars will tell the story
Of our love and all its glory
Let us take this night of magic
And make it a night of love
Won't you please surrender to me (surrender)
"Your lips, your arms, your heart, dear (surrender)"
Be mine forever
"You kiss me darling, a miracle starts"
"A magic feeling, comes into our hearts"
"The spell of love began, when we're alone"
"And we're in, a world of our own"
"You say you want me, and music I hear"
"Touch me my darling, and clouds disappear"
"The sky is bright above, and cares have flown"
"Holding you close, is heaven"
"Only I know, what it's worth"
"Knowing you're mine, forever"
Is the greatest wonder on earth
"Nothing can change it, the magic's begun"
"When we're together, our hearts become one"
"I find a happiness, I've never known"
"When we're in, a world of our own"
When we're in...a world of our own
"The walls have ears, ears that hear each little sound you make"
"Every time you stamp, throw a lamp, and every cup and dish you break"
But they can't hear a kiss or two arms that hold you tight
"So come on baby, don't fight tonight"
"The walls have ears, better think before you fling that shoe"
"If you part my hair with a chair, they'll spread the news to Timbuktu"
"Jets can fly, fast and high, rockets can go even faster"
But they can't catch or even match sound traveling through plaster
Just dim the light
Don't fight tonight
"Happy ending, happy ending"
Give me a story with a happy ending
When boy meets girl and then they never part again
But live forever happily like you and me
Hard luck stories get me so upset
Like Romeo and Juliet
I'm not smart enough to figure why
Some folks enjoy a real good cry
"(You and me, you and me, you and me, you and me)"
Never thought that I would stand a chance
That you'd give me a second glance
But I think that you can play the part
And give a guy a happy heart
(You and me)
"Like you and me, like you and me"
"(You and me, you and me, like you and me)"
"Ooh yes we're coming in loaded, Ooh yes we're coming in loaded"
I'll hold the boat steady brother like a rock
Full speed ahead until we hit the dock
"We're heading for home, the fishing was great"
We're comin' in loaded 'cause we're all out of bait
"Well, well, well, well, well"
Oh well now yeah!
We got 'em packed to the water-line
Some got away but the catch was fine
"Never saw such big ones, man oh man"
We're comin' in loaded just as fast as we can
I'm gonna see my baby soon as I get back
Knock on the door with my pockets packed
She'll look at me well she can't say no
We're comin' in loaded so come on let's go
Yeah! we're coming in loaded
Feel so bad
Like a ball game on a rainy day
Yes I got my rain check
Shake my head and walk away
Oooo-people that's the way I feel
Sometimes I think I want
Then again I think I don't
Sometimes I want to stay here
Then again I want to leave here
Then again I want to stay
"Yes, I got my train fare"
Pack my grip and ride away
Are you lonesome tonight?
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray
To a bright sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain
Shall I come back again?
"Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?"
Spoken:
I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each of us must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
"Then came act two, you seemed to changed, you acted strange"
And why I've never know
"Honey, you lied when you said you loved me"
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down
"Little sister, don't you"
"Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice"
Then say it's very nice
And then you run
Do what your big sister done
"Well, I dated your big sister"
And I took her to a show
I went for some candy
Along came Jim Dandy
And they snuck right out of the door
Every time I see your sister
Well she's got somebody new
She's mean and she's evil
Like that little old boll weevil
Guess I'll try my luck with you
"Well, I used to pull your pigtails"
And pinch your turned-up nose
But you been a growing
"And baby, it's been showing"
From your head down to your toes
I memorize the note you sent
Go all the places that we went
I seem to search the whole day through
For anything that's part of you
I kept a ribbon from your hair
A breath of perfume lingers there
It helps to cheer me when I'm blue
Anything that's part of you
"Oh, how it hurts to miss you so"
When I know you don't love me anymore
To go on needing you
Knowing you don't need me
No reason left for me to live
"What can I take, what can I give"
When I'd give all of someone new
Her hair is soft and her eyes
Are oh so blue
She's all the things a girl should be
But she's not you
She knows just how to make me laugh
When I feel blue
She's everything a man could want
And when we're dancing
It almost feels the same
I've got to stop myself from
Whispering your name
She even kisses me like
You used to do
And it's just breaking my heart
'Cause she's not you
I've gotta stop myself from
Because she's not you
Cause she's not you
I'm just a Smokey mountain boy
Come back to the hills I love
Where the tops of pine all bend in the wind
And the deep blue sky above
The closer and closer I get to home
The more excited I am
Those were the mornings I'd roll out of bed
Start the day off with a hot corn bread
Smothered in huckleberry jam
I can almost hear the hounds running through the woods
Close on the trail of the hare
How I long to be with them following the hounds a-hunting again
Getting me a big old grizzly bear
I traveled around and met lots of girls
No matter how many I see
I left some pretty ones behind
I know back home is where I'll find
The girl whose love means for me
Won't you show me how to kiss
Put your lips on mine
Do you do it just like this
Tell me I'm doing fine
We got a good thing going now take your time
Come on and make it last
"Love may be new to you but ooh, I'm catching on fast"
"Give, give, give me all you've got to give"
"Love, love, love every moment you live"
Now you've taught me all you know
Have I passed the test
Show me all you've got to show
Baby you're the best
But tell me I've learned quickly and I know each trick
I'm sure love's going to last
Love maybe new to you but Oooh I'm catching on fast
There's a legend of a famous matador
Who went to meet El Toro
Though he fought as he had never done before
"He could not beat, El Toro"
"The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain"
"And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame"
They said time would never heal the many scars
"Brought by the great, El Toro"
And the bitterness that burned deep in his heart
"Caused him to hate, El Toro"
"So one night, when no-one was in sight"
"The matador, went to settle the score"
"In the lonely fields, beneath the pale moonlight"
"He sought the bull, and they fought once more"
"When they found the matador, they saw him dying"
He'd never see tomorrow
Now they say that on the spot where he was lying
Still walks the proud El Toro
No-one's in a hurry
No-one seems to worry
Why they're all so happy is very clear
"Every day siesta, every night fiesta"
I think I'm gonna like it here
All this lovely scenery
There's more to it than greenery
I know a chance for romance is always near
"Mission bells are ringing, everybody's singing"
I think I'm gonna like it hear
The sound of laughter from every doorway
Sweet music floating across the square
It seems to say things are going better
Your troubles like bubbles will soon disappear in the air
"Down to my last peso, but I'm not afraid to say so"
"I feel just like a brave, Spanish cavalier"
"I don't care where we go, so lead on ""mi amigo"""
"Melodias, lapieras"
"I don't care where we go, so lead on"" mi amigo"""
"I said, ""Take it easy, baby"
I worked all day and my feet feel just like lead
You got my shirt tails flying all over the place
"And the sweat popping out of my head"""
"She said, ""Hey, bossa nova baby"
"Keep on working for this ain't no time to quit"""
"She said, ""Go, bossa nova baby keep on dancing"
"I'm about to have myself a fit"""
"Bossa nova, bossa nova"
"I said, ""Hey little mama, let's sit down"
"Have a drink and dig the band"""
"She said, ""Drink, drink, drink oh, fiddle-de-dink"
"I can dance with a drink in my hand"""
"She said, ""Hey bossa nova baby"
"Keep on working for this ain't no time to drink"""
"She said, ""Go bossa nova baby"
"Keep on dancing, cause I ain't got time to think"""
"I said, ""Come on baby, it's hot in here"
And it's oh so cool outside
"If you lend me a dollar, I can buy some gas"
"And we can go for a little ride"""
"Keep on working for I ain't got time for that"""
"Keep on dancing or I'll find myself another cat"""
Anyone could fall in love with you
Anyone who knows you as I do
And I love you my darling
Anyone could lose his heart like me
Anyone who has eyes that can see
Anyone could fall in love like me
You're the star I reached for
You're a dream so rare
You're my greatest treasure
Nothing can compare
Anyone could want you for his own
Anyone not only mine alone
"You can't say no, in Acapulco"
With every beat your heart will answer yes
Where lovers sing instead of talk
And dance instead of walk together
"In a night, that's filled with stars"
And strumming guitars
"Where romance blooms, and love is in the air"
"So kiss me tender, love me true"
Darling feel this magic too
"Don't say no, you can't say no, in Acapulco"
"Guadalajara, Guadalajara"
Tienes el alma de provinciana
"Hueles a limpio, a rosa temprana"
A verde jara fresca del río
Son mil palomas tu caserío
Sabes a pura tierra mojada
"Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay"
Ay! Colomitos lejanos
Ay! Ojitos de agua hermanos
Ay colomitos inolvidables
Inolvidables como las tardes
"En que la lluvia, desde la loma"
Nos nos dejaba ir hasta Zapopan
Ay mis hermanos ay-ay-ay Mexicano
May this tenderness cling
When the fire of Spring
Is a memory
May you still be my own
When a hundred years have flown
But if it can't be
Give this moment to me
While our dream is bright
Put your sweet arms around me
And love me tonight
Love me tonight
Let me feel your lips on mine
And though I pray
Forever and a day I'll be
Possessing you
I'll confess to you
If I knew that our love would be gone
With the stars in the dawn's grey light
I'd still hold you close and whisper
Slowly but surely I'm gonna wear you down
Slowly but surely I'm gonna bring you round
"To my way of thinking, my way of kissing, my way of loving"
"Slowly but surely, I'm gonna make you mine"
"I ain't gonna rush yeah, I'll let you meditate"
Though I wanna crush yeah my arms will have to wait
"I'll just take it easy, so nice and easy, real cool really"
"Oh yeah! Mm-mm, I've got a feeling I'm not wasting my time"
Oh yeah! When you get the message it's going to be fine
"Slowly but surely, the table's gonna turn"
"Slowly but surely, your lips are gonna burn"
"For what you've been missing is my kind of kissing, my kind of loving"
I'm gonna make you mine
All you got is one life
Living once can be rough
But if you live every day all the way
Once is enough
You can own just one suit
Worn and torn at the cuff
But if you're living the life that you love
What's the good of reaching ninety
If you waste eighty-nine
You got one life so live it
If you don't it's a crime
Life's a playful puppy
You can grab by the scruff
And if you live every second what the heck
Never wait until tomorrow
What if it never comes
Life is a seven layer
Don't you settle for crumbs
"Well I've got a gal, she's as cute as she can be"
She's a distant cousin but she's not too distant with me
We'll kiss all night
I'll squeeze her tight
But we're Kissin cousins and that's what makes it all right
"All right, all right, all right"
Oh I've got a girl and she taught me how to live
She can give a lot and she's got a lot to give
"Yes we're all cousins, that's what I believe"
Because we're children of Adam and Eve
I got a girl and she wants a lot of love
That's the kind of trouble I need plenty of
But we'll be kissing cousins and that'll make it all right
We'll be Kissing cousins that'll make it all right
We'll be kissing cousins that's what makes it all right
It's a long lonely highway when you're travelling all alone
And it's a mean old world when you got no-one to call your own
"And you pass through towns too small to even have a name, oh yes"
"But you got to keep on going, on that road to nowhere"
"Got to keep on going, though there's no-one to care"
Just keep moving down the line
It's a long lonely highway without her by my side
And it's a trail full of teardrops that keep on being cried
My heart's so heavy it's a low down dirty shame oh yes
"You got to keep on going, on that road to nowhere"
I got to rock for my pillow beneath a weeping willow
And the cool grass for my bed
My drinking water's muddy so don't you tell me buddy
That I wouldn't be better off dead
It's a long lonely highway getting longer all the time
And if she don't come and get me
"Well, I'm going to lose my mind"
"So if you read about me tell her she's the one to blame, oh yes"
Moving down the line
"Girl happy, yes I'm girl happy"
"Girl happy, can't you see"
Every girl I see looks good to me
What a crazy way out way to be
I love a life of nothing but beautiful women
"Well I'm Girl happy, yes I'm girl happy"
Every time I see a pretty face
My heart just heads for outer space
I need a girl to make my life worth living
"Yes, I'm Girl happy, yes I'm girl happy"
I've been like this since I was just a baby boy
First nurse that ever rocked my cradle made me jump for joy
Mama keep your daughter out of sight
I'm in a loving mood tonight
"Girl happy, well I'm girl happy"
"Yes I'm girl happy, can't you see"
"Girl happy, said I'm girl happy"
"A little bird, he told me so"
"He said come on, get on the go"
Open your eyes the sky is full of butterflies
The blossoms on the trees stir up the honey bees
Spring makes my fever right
"Spring fever, Spring is here at last"
"Spring fever, my heart's beating fast"
"Get up, get out spring is everywhere"
Well if you feel the wanderlust
Just grab a car or hop a bus
In every town there's excitement to be found
So much is happening
Don't miss the joy of spring
The world's in love just look around
Spring fever comes to everyone
"Spring fever, it's time for fun"
"Spring fever, it's Spring fever time"
"Spring fever, watch that fever climb"
Spring is everywhere
I'm just a roustabout
Shifting from town to town
"No job can hold me down, I'm just a knock-around guy"
There's a lot of space beneath that sky
Till I find my place there's no doubt
I'll be a roving' roustabout
Call me the carefree kind
I wander with the breeze
My mind and heart's at ease
Doing what pleases me best
Gotta keep-a movin' east or west
"And even if a pretty girl, should catch my eye"
"I'll give her a quick ""hello"", and a fast goodbye"
I'll go the way I want
Drifting' just like the sand
Doing' what job I can
Changing my plans as I choose
Long as I keep happy I can't lose
"I'll be a roving' roustabout,  I'll be a roving' roustabout"
"I'll be a roving' roustabout, Rovin', Rovin' roustabout"
"Young as a circus parade, it's a wonderful world"
"Pretty as pink lemonade, it's a wonderful world"
"Life is a carnival, live it for all your worth"
You are the star of the greatest show on earth
This big wide world is a clown with his nose painted red
A rainbow colored balloon's dancing high overhead
"It's everyone's oyster, step up get your pearl"
"It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world"
Come on kids from eight to eighty
Hey there mister bring your lady
There's a big show on the inside
It's carnival time
"Popcorn, peanuts and cotton candy"
Pink lemonade that's dan-dan-dandy
Be a big shot for a dollar
Roustabouts roustabouting
"And there's happy shouts, children shouting"
If you've got doubts quit your doubting'
"There's thrills, it's spice"
It's cheap at half the price
"So don't be bashful, buy a ticket"
Get the habit never kick it
"Hit the band there, don't just stand there"
"Aha-ha hurry, hurry step this way"
Now the show you're gonna see is strictly high class
There'll be ten hula dancers shaking their grass
So step right up and put your money down
This way to Carny Town
We got a man so skinny you can see his bones
We play on his ribs like a xylophone
With a pair of spoons we get a Rockin' song
"You'll hear it all, in Carny Town"
"Hurry, hurry, hurry, the house is almost full"
We got a two headed cow and that's no bull
There's a man who swallows swords and he never gets hurt
He eats razor blades for dessert
He's just about the sharpest guy around
"You'll see him here, in Carny Town"
Aha-ha I say we're gonna win
I said hurry up
"Gotta do some living, got the wanderlust"
Better clear the highway cause I'm gonna move some dust
"Oh I got wheels, wheels on my heels"
"And I gotta keep rolling, rolling along"
Lots of pretty dollies try to fence me in
But I love and leave them cause a tumbleweed's my kin
"Why do I keep moving', never settling' down"
Can it be I'm looking for a dream I haven't found
"And I gotta keep Rolling, rolling along"
"She'll tell you that she loves you, make you feel just like a king"
"She'll cry to you and lie to you, she'll do almost anything"
She'll get right up next to you and the first thing that you know
You'll be telling her you're sorry because she hurt you so
I said she's evil the most evil girl I've found
"There ain't no doubt about it, she's the meanest girl in town"
She'll invite you over to her house at half past nine
"You'll wear a suit, you'll wear a tie and you'll give your shoes a shine"
You'll take a real deep breath and knock on her front door
"Her little sister will tell you ""She don't live here anymore"""
"There is no doubt about it, she's the meanest girl in town"
"And there is no doubt about it, she's the meanest girl in town"
She'll put her arms around you and squeeze with all her might
She'll breathe a sigh and pucker her lips and close her eyes real tight
"Your heart will pound like thunder, you'll melt in her embrace"
But when you go to kiss her well she'll laugh right in your face
Because she's evil the most evil girl I've found
Hey everybody gather round
And listen to that bongo sound
Grab the first one in your reach
Now we're going to shake the beach
"Do the Clam, do the Clam"
Grab your barefoot baby by the hand
"Turn and tease, hug and squeeze"
Dig right in and do the Clam
You can get your heart to spin
On the outside looking in
The moon ain't going to last all night
Let's work up an appetite
Everybody's got that beat
"Well, listen to those happy feet"
Ain't you glad that you found out
What the Clam is all about
Oh and grab your barefoot baby by the hand
I've got to find my baby
I wonder where can she be
Has anybody seen her
Send her back to me
She left me here all alone
And I ain't had no loving
Since my baby's been gone
My baby's gone
I got to hold her tight and tell her I love her
Tell her everything's all right
So I'll keep searching
All night long
Got to find my baby
"Come along, come along, there's a full moon shining bright"
"Come along, come along, we're gonna hit St. Louis tonight"
Spend your money looking at the chorus line
"Spend your money, win it on the number 9"
Take your sweetheart even though she's never been
If she's worried tell her that you always win
"Come along, come along, you're gonna win a fortune tonight"
"Hear the whistle, lady luck's about to go"
"Is she smiling, maybe yes or maybe no"
Now's the time when nights are filled with sweet romance
Don't be bashful step on up and take a chance
"Come along, come along, we're gonna win a fortune tonight"
"What's in the drink, chase the Devil away"
Magic I think so I just say Chesay
"Chesay, Chesay bring you good luck night and day"
"Chesay, Chesay that's the gypsy way"
Trouble is my middle name
Though it's such a crying shame
Try and try there's nothing I can do
But I'm feeling kinda strange
Feel like things are going to change
Time my lucky star was shining through
Drink a cup of gypsy love
Just tip it up and then you just say Chesay
Swallow once then swallow twice
"Goes down so nice just say Chesay, hey"
"Chesay, Chesay brings you good luck night and day"
Chesay
She may say she needs fancy bangles and beads
That's part of a woman's plan
But what every woman lives for
What every woman lives for
Is to give her love to a man
Wise men have known women can't live alone
So a woman should understand
That what every woman lives for
He may not be the kind you find in picture books
A real life hero with dashing handsome looks
He may not be the guy that you've been dreaming of
But that won't stop you from giving him your love
"So dear, can't you see that it was meant to be"
"It's part, part of our destiny"
Cause what every woman lives for
And I hope that man is me
"Oh, when the saints go marching in"
"Well, when the saints go marching in"
"I wanna be right there in that number, number"
When the saints go marching in
"Yeah, when the sun refuse to shine"
When the sun refuse to shine
"Go, go go"
"When the saints, the saints go marching in"
Everybody listen to me
Put a smile on your face
There's no reason to be gloomy
This world's a wonderful place
So when I say again happy
Shout it out
"Yeh, get happy now shout it out"
Well there is no doubt you've a lot to shout about
Give a yell life is swell shout it out
Hey there little girl don't be sad
There's such good times to be had
Count your blessings one by one
"Life's a ball, after all have some fun"
"I said C'mon get happy, shout it out"
Now there's good feeling you can taste
While there's music life's no waste
While there's great things happening
There's no end to the joy life can bring
As long as there's somebody you can love
As long as bright stars shine above
You've got no reason to be blue
Think what it means when all your dreams come true
I said now there is no doubt you've a lot to shout about
There is no doubt you've a lot to shout about
I may not be here tomorrow
But I'm close beside you today
"So lie to me a little, say you love me a lot"
And I'll be true to you in my way
Love never goes on forever
At least that's what wise men all say
"So smile when you kiss me, tomorrow you may cry"
But I'll be true to you in my way
"Yes, I'll be true to you in my way"
Tomorrow night
Will you remember what you said tonight?
Will all thrills be gone?
Tomorrow night (tomorrow night)
Will it be just another memory
Or just another lovely song
That's in my fool heart to linger on?
Your lips are so tender
Your heart is beating fast
And you're willing to surrender
"Tell me, darling, will it last?"
Will you be with me when the moon's bright?
Will you say those lovely things you said tonight?
Will you say those lovely things
You said tonight?
Please don't stop loving me
You were born just to be in my arms
In my arms
Your lips were made just to be kissed by me
Kissed by me
"I don't know day from night, wrong from right"
"You are my world, that's all I know"
"I love you so, I won't let go"
Darling you'll always be mine alone
Mine alone
"Long distance information give me Memphis, Tennessee"
Help me find the party trying to get in touch with me
"She could not leave her number, but I know who placed the call"
"My uncle took the message, and he wrote it on the wall"
"Help me, information, to get in touch with my Marie"
"She's the only one who'd phone me here from Memphis, Tennessee"
"Her home is on the south side, high upon a ridge"
Just a half a mile from the Mississippi bridge
"Help me, information, more than that I cannot add"
Only that I miss her and all the fun we had
But we were pulled apart because her mom did not agree
"Tore apart our happy home in Memphis, Tennessee"
"The last time I saw Marie, she was waving me goodbye"
With hurry home drops on her cheek that trickled from her eye
"Marie is only six years old, Information please"
"Try to put me through to her in Memphis, Tennessee"
Everybody come aboard The Showboat tonight

"Forget your troubles, forget your strife"
You'll have the best time of your life
"Hey everyone let's go, on with the show"
Everybody's gonna gamble on The Showboat tonight

"Way down by the levee, the boats at the bank"
Bring money to spend your welcome my friend
Just walk up the plank

We'll guarantee that you'll have a ball
Come on one and all
Well what a great night you've got in store
You'll wanna keep coming back for more
What a great night you've got in store
You're gonna keep coming back for more
I told you that some day
If you kept on being untrue
Somebody else would come along
And release me from you
You'll be glad to know now
Your fickle heart
Can have its own way
For it finally happened
I've met her today
I used to think I just couldn't live
A day without you
In spite of the thousand doubts and tears
That you put me through
All at once I don't care as much for you
I'm sorry to say
For now there's another
I met her today
"How I treasured each smile, each kiss"
You gave to me now and then
"Well, you needn't be kind to me now"
"Oh no, not ever again"
Just when the last bit of pride in me was gone
Someone heard me pray
And sent me my angel
"You know what it takes, you got it, baby"
You are the only one I chose
"I got a feeling for you, baby"
And you're the only one who knows
"About my troubles, troubles, troubles"
"When it rains, it really pours"
"You shouldn't have took away my love, dear"
You know you thrill me from head to toe
"You got what you wanted, now you left me"
That's the way the story goes
"Well, I got troubles, troubles, troubles"
"Going to travel, going to travel wild and free"
I'm going to pack my bags because this great big world is calling me
Every pretty girl's going to know I'm around
They're going to know I'm in town on a harem holiday
"Twenty women, twenty women by my side"
"I'm going to kiss them all, because I've got to keep them satisfied"
Going to have the best time money can buy
I'm going to be flying high on a harem holiday
If Romeo had a harem holiday
You can bet that Juliet would have never been his girl forever
"Going to go back, going to catch that midnight plane"
Twenty dancing girls are waiting just to call my name
Catch that midnight plane
"Going to have a ball, I am not going to waste no time"
I'm going to make them all mine on a harem holiday
"When you meet by chance, it's not by chance"
It's kismet
"When two hearts stand still, it's destiny's will"
"The wheel of fortune spins, round and around it goes"
"Who will the arrow point to, only kismet knows"
"Until you came by, kismet and I were strangers"
"But now that you're here, it's suddenly clear we've met"
"This is my lucky day, love's in the cards I'd say"
"Thanks to kismet, kismet, kismet"
"Hey little girl, you sure are cute to me"
"Come up a little closer, so I can see"
Hold it baby now stay right where you are
Hey little girl you oughta be a movie star
All right
"Hey little girl, come on and dance with me"
You're about the cutest thing I ever did see
"Hey little girl, I'd like to take you home"
"Come on, come on, come on I want you for my very own"
All right hoo! hoo!
"Hey little girl, you better hang on tight"
"A-won't you swing it to the left, and shake it to the right"
"Hey little girl, you know you're looking fine"
Get ready honey let's go just-a one more time
Don't ever take your eyes off me
Not even for a minute
'Cause like a panther I might pounce
And there'll be danger in it
"I can be sneaky, fast as a snake"
"I strike like a cobra, make no mistake"
"And baby you'll be trapped, quick as a wink"
It's animal instinct
Don't think that I won't pin you down
No matter how you plead it
I'm like a lion who's been caged
And you're the meat I'm needin'
"Watch out I'll warn you, sharp as a hawk"
"I'm wild as a tiger, I prowl and I stalk"
"Because when a man feels thirst, he takes a drink"
You better not be caught off guard
This wolf is on the search now
A leopard just can't change its spots
And I'm about to lurch now
"I roar like the jungle, I fight tooth and nail"
"I just gotta get you, you'll fall without fail"
"I'm ready for the kill, I was right on the brink"
"It's animal instinct, animal instinct"
"Listen, to the wisdom of the ages"
"Listen, to the words of many sages"
"Live each day, as if it were your last"
"It's written in the stars, your destiny is cast"
"And that hourglass, runs too fast no doubt"
For the sands of time are running out
"These words, can be found in history's pages"
"Live each day, for happiness can't wait"
"And love while you may, but heed the hand of fate"
"If the finger points, it's too late no doubt"
"For the sands of time, are running out"
"But the man who turns, and escapes somehow"
Is the wisest of men
"And to such a man, I'd bow"
"Hawaii, U.S.A., Hawaii U.S.A"
"We're flying, coming your way"
"Aloha, Hawaii U.S.A"
"Gee it's great, to be in that fiftieth state"
The land of enchanted dreams
"What an isle, where it's heaven tropical style"
"Where love weaves a spell, it seems"
"Gee what fun, just to swim and surf in the sun"
While the trade winds caress the sea
"What a sight, those exotic scenes of delight"
Are waiting for you and me
"Hawaii, U.S.A  Hawaii  U.S.A  Hawaii  U.S.A"
She sells sea shells by the seashore
But I know a girl who sells so much more
"Queenie Wahine's Papaya rates higher than pineapple, pumpkin or poi"
Please pick her papaya put Queenie Wahine in perfect perpetual joy
Though some people's palates prefer pickled salads
Plum pudding pink popcorn peach pie
Oh Queenie's papaya you'll truly desire
When that Queenie Wahine passes by
"Drums of the islands, you're beating in my heart"
You're with me no matter where I roam
"If ever I wander, if ever we're apart"
I know that you will lead me home
If I should journey across the deep blue sea
I'll never forget these coral shores
"Drums of the islands, I hear you calling me"
And I'll return forever yours
"I love each valley, each grain of sand, each hill"
"The flowers, the music of the isles"
These are the things I love and always will
Though I may roam ten thousand miles
When I was a little bitty boy
Sitting on my papa's knee
I still remember every word my papa said to me
Now boy if you ever meet
A pretty woman walking down the street
You'd better
"Stop real still, look both ways"
Listen or you'll get in trouble
When you see her go strutting by
Giving you that evil eye
And she's got a kind of dreamy look
Just enough to get you shook
Now boy don't you lose your head
You pay attention what your papa said
All right !
She'll drive you crazy with the way she walks
She'll drive you crazy with the way she talks
And you'll think you're going to lose your mind
Cause that pretty woman looks so fine
And the very first thing you'll know
You'll be telling her you love her so
You'd better stop real still
"Look out now, I'm running wild"
There ain't no holding back this child
I guess you'd say I'm a son of a gun
Living just for a life of fun
Here's the secret of my success
"Never say yes, no, no, never say yes"
Life has taught me one big lesson
Always keep the girl's guessing
Tell them that you love them so
You hate to leave but you got to go
It's the oldest game in the world
And you got to know how to play it
Tell her yes in so many ways
But never ever say it
And that's how I keep going on
"Here today, tomorrow gone"
That's the kind of life for me
Being free like I want to be
Now that's how I keep going on
And that's the kind of life for me
"No, no, never say yes"
"Some like their women short, some like them tall"
I'll take them any size cause I love them all
I'm just wild about smorgasbord
I got a craving for smorgasbord
"A little kiss here, a little kiss there"
That's smorgasbord
Mm
"Some take just apple pie, some take just cake"
"I'll take the dish I please, please the dish I take"
"Some like just southern belles, they got a one track mind"
I go for all the belles except the wedding kind
"I'll take them any size cause I love them all, Mm"
If today was not endless highway
If tonight was not an endless trail
If tomorrow wasn't such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to me at all
Yes and only if my own true love was waiting
If I could hear her heart softly pounding
Only she was lying by me
Then I'd lie in my bed once again
I can't see my reflection in the water
I can't speak the sounds that show no pain
I can't hear the echo of my footsteps
I can't remember the sound of my own name
If only she was lying by me
There's beauty in the silver singing river
There's beauty in the sunrise in the sky
But none of these and nothing else could match the beauty
That I remember in my true love's eyes
If today was not an endless highway
If tonight was not endless trail
"Janie, Janie, Janie, Janie, Jane Jane"
"Down in the alley, just you and me"
We're going bowling till half past three
"Just rocking and reeling, we'll get that feeling"
"Down in the alley, oh baby Gee"
I plant you now and dig you later
'Cause you're a fine sweet potato
We'll have a ball and that ain't all
The clock is striking a mournful sound
This time of evening my love comes down
That's when I'm missing your kind of kissing
"Down in the alley, that's where I'll be"
"Alright, oh"
"Down in the alley, we sure have fun"
We just get started 'bout half past one
So if you're 'round just come on down
Down in the alley and you will see
"Janie, Janie, Janie, Janie, Jane"
I'll remember you
Long after this endless summer has gone
"I'll be lonely, oh so lonely"
Living only to remember you
Your voice as soft as the warm summer breeze
"Your sweet laughter, mornings after"
"Ever after, I'll remember you"
"To your arms someday, I'll return to stay"
Till then I will remember too
Every bright star we made wishes upon
"Love me always, promise always"
"Ooh, you'll remember too"
(I'll remember you)
I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses
And he walks with me
And he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
He speaks and the sound of his voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that he gave to me
Within my heart is ringing
(We'll understand it all by and by)
Tempted and tried we're oft' made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
"Never molested, though in the wrong"
Farther along we'll know more about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by
When death has come and taken our loved ones
Leaving our homes so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder how others prosper
Living so wicked year after year
When the storms of life are raging
Stand by me
When the world is tossing me
Like a ship out on the sea
Thou who rulest wind and water
When I'm growing old and feeble
When I do the best I can
And my friends misunderstand
Thou who never lost a battle
Without Him I could do nothing
Without Him I'd surely fail
Without Him I would be drifting
Like a ship without a sail
Without Him I would be dying
Without Him I'd be enslaved
Without Him life would be worthless
But with Jesus thank God I'm saved
"Oh Jesus, oh Jesus"
Do you know Him today
Please don't turn Him away
"Oh Jesus, my Jesus"
Without Him how lost I would be
It is so high
"(So high, you can't get over it)"
So wide
(So wide you can't get around it)
So low
(So low you can't get under it)
Great God Almighty
(You must come in at the door)
Oh it is high
(So high you can't get over it)
It is wide
You might as well..
Well I went down in the valley
You know I didn't go  there to stay
My soul got happy in the valley
You know I stayed right there all day
Well I ain't been to heaven
But I'm told
The streets the streets are pearls
You know the mighty mighty mighty gates are gold
Well it is high
I know it's so low
You might as well come in at the door
I don't know just what I'd do
If the Lord wasn't walking by my side
When I was drifting
(When I was drifting on the sea of a despair)
And I was wondering
(I was wondering if Jehovah's up there)
When Jesus found me
(Jesus found me in my sinful life)
He heard me praying
(He heard me praying on my knees at night)
And now I'm singing
(Now I'm singing this happy song)
Because I'm happy
(Because I'm happy as I go along)
And I don't know
(I don't know)
Just what I'd do
What would I do
(What would I do when a tear fills my eyes)
(What would I do when it's my time to die)
"Well I'd be lonely, discouraged"
Burdened on the way
If the Lord wasn't walking by my side every day
I'd be so friendless
(I'd be friendless all alone and blue)
And I'd be helpless
"(I'd be helpless, wouldn't know what to do)"
If the Lord (wasn't walking) wasn't walking by my side
(wasn't walking by my side)
Well you may run on for a long time
Run along for a long time
Run on for a long time
Let me tell you God almighty gonna cut you down
"Go tell that long tongued liar, oh well well"
"Go tell that midnight rider, oh well well"
"Tell the gambler, the rambler, the back-biter"
Tell them God almighty gonna cut 'em down
Stop God almighty let me tell you the news
My head's been wet with the midnight dews
I've been down on my bended knees
Talking to the man from Galilee
My God spoke and he spoke so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of angel's feet
He put one hand upon my head
Great God almighty let me tell you what he said
You may throw your rock and hide your hand
Working in the dark against your fellow man
As sure as God made the day and the night
What you do in the dark will be brought to the light
"You may run and hide, slip and slide"
Trying to take the mote from your neighbor’s eye
As sure as God made the rich and poor
You going to reap just what you sow
Some people go to church just to sit in the fire
Trying to make a date with the neighbor’s wife
Brother let me tell you as sure as you're born
You better leave that woman alone
Because one of these days mark my word
You think that brother is going to work
And you'll sneak up and knock on that door
That's all brother you'll knock no more
When shadows beckon on dim-lit avenues
Night people hear the call
"From hidden alleys, and secret rendezvous"
They come out one and all
The city by night eyes wide awake
It never sleeps make no mistake
Whatever sets off the spark
A magic glow lights the dark
Then I'm intrigued by the sight
Of the city by night
Those crowded nightclubs
Those picturesque cafes
Are scenes no-one forgets
"And I'm enchanted, music softly plays"
By dancing silhouettes
The evening's full of surprise
It's magic opens my eyes
And I'm intrigued by the sight
"Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-i-ee-i-o"
"And on that farm he had some chicks, ee-i-ee-i-o"
"With a cluck, cluck here, a cluck, cluck there"
Loud as they could be
And when those chicks got out of line
Chicken fricassee
"Well, Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-i-ee-i-o"
"And on that farm he had some cows, ee-i-ee-i-o"
"With a moo, moo here, a moo, moo there"
Cattle everywhere
And when those cows got out of line
"Hamburger, medium rare"
"Oh, Well, Old MacDonald had a farm, ee-i-ee-i-o"
"And on that farm he had some pigs, ee-i-ee-i-o"
"With an oink, oink here, an oink, oink there"
Pigs everywhere in sight
And when those pigs got out of line
Pork and beans at night
"Well I'm going to have a farm one day, ee-i-e-i-o"
"And I'll do things MacDonald's way, ee-i-e-i-o"
"A moo, moo here, a moo, moo there"
"An oink, oink here, an oink, oink there"
And I can promise you
If those animals ever get out of line
We'll have a mulligan stew
How about you?
"Well, I quit my job down at the car wash"
I left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown I'd left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
For the next three weeks I went hunting them nights
Just looking for a place to play
"Well, I thought my picking would set them on fire"
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man
"Well, I nearly about starved to death down in Memphis"
I run out to money and luck
"So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia"
On a overloaded poultry truck
I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started picking out some of them all night bars
Hoping I could make myself a dollar
Making music on my guitar
I got the same old story at them all night piers
There is no room around here for a guitar man
"We don't need a guitar man, son"
So I slept in the hobo jungles
Roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile Alabama
At a club they call Big Jack's
A little four-piece band was jamming
So I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed them what a band would sound like
With a swinging little guitar man
"Show them, son"
If you ever take a trip down to the ocean
Find yourself down around Mobile
Make it on out to a club called Jack's
If you got a little time to kill
Just follow that crowd of people
You'll wind up out on his dance floor
Digging the finest little five-piece group
Up and down the Gulf of Mexico
Guess who's leading that five-piece band
"Well, wouldn't you know, it's that swinging little guitar man"
"Well, I came a long way from the car wash"
Got to where I said I'd get
Now that I'm here I know for sure
I really have not got there yet
Think I'll start all over
Swing my guitar over my back
I'm going to get myself back on the track
"I'll never, never ever look back"
I'll never be more than what I am
Wouldn't you know
I'm a swinging little Guitar man
Hey
"Clambake, gonna have a clambake"
"Mamma's little baby loves clambake, clambake"
Mamma's little baby loves clambake too
"Hey, listen world you've got to know"
I'm cutting loose and letting go
Who needs the worry and the strife
Life can be a ball now just following my life
Look for the brightest lights in town
That's where you'll find me hanging round
I've got this feeling to be free
I pick and choose the life I want and that's the life for me
"Clambake, gonna to have a clambake"
"(Mamma's little baby loves clambake, clambake)"
(Mamma's little baby loves clambake too)
"Baby it's wrong, wrong as can be"
To try and tie a guy like me
I could never settle down in a little sleepy town
There is so much world to see
Sure would be happy for a while
But then we'd have to part
When tears replace your loving smile
"Well, I don't want to be the guy"
Who has to break your heart
"So, here's where it ends, not lovers but friends"
Though your lips are tempting me
Maybe I'm a fool and yet
This wanderer just can't forget
"For me, there's so much world to see"
"Yeah, yeah"
I can see you now living like a queen
"In a house that has everything, everything but love"
"Crystal chandeliers, chauffeured limousines"
"Yes you'll really have everything, everything but love"
"I see diamonds and sables, sapphires and pearls"
And as the picture clears
Poor little rich girl sitting all alone
Counting her treasures in tears
Better just a shack where two people care
"Than a house that has everything, everything but love"
"I see diamonds, sables, sapphires and pearls"
The shooting stars are coming out of your eyes
"They point the way, the way to paradise"
"I got a funny feeling, I can't be wrong"
It won't be long until the sparks will fly
It won't be long
"I hear a buzz, buzz around in my brain"
"But what it does, is bound to drive me insane"
At a time like this I must be strong
It won't be long till the sky falls down
"Love has taught me plenty, I'm still learning more"
Anything worth having is worth the waiting for
"Here I go, I'm on a one way trip"
Look out below because I'm about to flip
I tell you when these lips get to that kiss
It won't be long until we're out of this world
"It won't be long, it won't be long until we're out of this world"
"Line up girls, I'll show you what to do"
This boat will sparkle like a diamond when we get through
By the numbers there is not much time
We're gonna start an assembly line
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
"You get the sandpaper, you get the pails"
"You get the hammer baby, you get the nails"
"You get the paint, you get the brush"
Because we're gonna give it the special touch
We got a magic potion that will help us win
I don't know how to spell it but dip right in
"Glocoseoxytonicphosphate, it's the latest scoop"
"But that's all right girls you can call it ""Goop"""
"Work the sandpaper, hammer that nail"
Tote that paintbrush and lift that pail
"Get a rhythm going, nice and easy"
Come on and use a little elbow greasy
"O.K. Girls, we're all through"
I'm going to tell you what we're gonna do
We'll fall right down and have some fun
And I'm gonna kiss you all one by one
Walk down to the beach at sunset
Look as far as you can see
You will find that endless ocean
And that's how my love will always be
"I bring you never ending, never ending"
"Never ending, never ending"
"Never ending, never ending love"
Look up at the sky at midnight
Gaze up on the starlit view
Just as heaven has no boundaries
Neither does my love for you
Never ending love
"Blue river, it can't be found on any map that I know"
But it's the place where lonely lovers all go
"To cry their tears, blue river"
It winds along a path of heartache and pain
Of broken dreams from loving someone in vain
"Like I loved you, and baby I still do"
I held you so tight
You were out of my sight
I'm feeling so low
But I got to go
Blue river because you never really cared about me
From now on baby that's where I'm going to be
"Crying over you, by the river of blue"
Like a ship without a compass on a cold lonely sea
No beacon light of love to guide me through
I lost the only treasure that means anything to me
"What now, what next, where to?"
I thought I had a love that would be mine eternally
I felt so sure you'd be forever true
Now everything I counted on has crumbled under you
"You were part of every dream I dreamed, of everything I planned"
How could I know our castles were built upon the sand
"Won't heaven send an angel please, to tell me what to do"
Love letters straight from your heart
Keep us so near while apart
I'm not alone in the night
When I can have all the love you write
I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign
"And, darling, then I read again right from the start"
"Don't do that, please stop it"
Please stop it now
You know I can't take it
My head is spinning a spell on me now
My head is spinning around and around
Your witchcraft has got me
Keep going down and down
"Let me forget her, don't mention her name"
You know it brings back that old burning flame
It hurts to know that she don't feel the same
I can't go on since she left me alone
"My one desire now is to cry, now to cry"
She might come back one day by by and by
The girl I never loved
Will never know I cared
And all my dreams of her
Are dreams I'll never share
For I want her and I need her
And I know it might have been
But it ended long before it could begin
The kiss I never got
Somebody else will take
The plans I never made
Somebody else will make
"Oh I'm lonely, I'm so lonely"
Because it's her I'm thinking of
But she'll always be the girl I never loved
"Never loved, never loved"
"Hey mama, don't you treat me wrong"
Come and love your daddy all night long
"All right, hey, hey, all right now"
See the girl with the diamond ring
She knows how to shake that thing
"All right, hey, hey, Mm, all right now"
"Ah, Oh, Ah, Oh, Ah, Oh, Oh"
"Make me feel so good, make me feel so good right now"
"Make me feel so good, make me feel so good"
"Mm, see the girl with the red dress on"
She can do the dog all night long
"All right, hmm what'd I say, tell me what'd I say"
"Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say right now"
"Tell me what'd I say, tell me what'd I say"
"It's all right, It's all right right now"
"Baby, it's all right, Baby, it's all right right now"
"Baby, it's all right, Oh yeah!"
"Baby shake that thing, baby shake that thing right now"
"Baby shake that thing, well I feel all right"
"Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?"
Can't you hear me when I call?
"Well you ain't so big, you know you just tall that's all, All right"
"Well you got me working, boss man"
Working round the clock
I want to little drink of water
But you won't let big Al stop
"Big boss man, now can't you hear me when I call? All right"
"I said you ain't so big, you know you just tall that's all"
"Big boss man, why can't you hear me when I call? All right"
"You know you ain't not so big, I said you just tall that's all, All right"
I'm going to get me a boss man
The one who's going to treat me right
I work hard in the day time
Rest easy at night
"Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call? Can't you hear me when I call?"
"I said you ain't so big, you just tall that's all"
One that's going to treat me right
I work hard in the evening
"Big boss man, big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?"
"All right, big boss man"
It's all right
Why must I love a heartless woman
Who never knows the harm she's done
Though love is blind I should have known
Just call me lonesome from now on
I climb the stairs up to my room
But no-one greets me in my gloom
The silence tells me she is gone
These walls will hide me when I cry
I hope that heaven lets me die
What good is life when hope has gone
Suppose no rose would ever grow again
Suppose no brook would ever flow again
Suppose no star should ever glow again
Suppose you didn't love me
Suppose there were no bees or butterflies
Suppose no bird should ever cross the skies
Suppose the sun should never never rise
It's impossible to imagine a world without a star
"But imagining no you is more impossible, by far"
Suppose the Springtime never should arrive
Suppose the tall green trees should not survive
Suppose I had no wish to be alive
"We're going up, we're going down"
"We're going up, down, down, up"
Any way you wanna let it roll
"Yeah, yeah, yeah"
You got me doin' what you want me
"Oh, baby, what you want me to do"
"You got me peeping, you got me hiding"
"You got me peep, hide, hide, peep"
This proud wild land where the wind blows free
Has always been a part of me
"It's in my blood, I just can't get it out"
For a hundred miles a man can see
And be about as wild as he wants to be
If he feels like shouting all he's got to do is shout
Where the purple mountains reach up high
And look like they're going to touch the sky
Where the canyon walls have stood for a million years
"Where the days are hot, the nights are cold"
The desert sand looks just like gold
These trails were carved in sweat and blood and tears
Where the painted desert as you pass by
Looks like a rainbow in the sky
The cactus blooms in the early morning sun
Where the nightwings sing and eagles fly
The clouds paint pictures in the sky
The coyotes howl tells you when the day is done
"I'm coming home, this time I'm going to stay"
I'm coming home and I am never going away
My feet are itching to get back home
I've had the desert fever since I've been gone
I need some loving so bad that I can't see
When a woman looks a man in the eye
You know it takes a man to satisfy
Thinking about them girls is killing me
"I'm going home, going home"
"Going home, I'm going home"
"Going home, going home"
Going home
Mine is a heart
That beats for only you
Mine is a love that always will be true
"For ever more, beyond the end of time"
"I will be your love, promise you'll be mine"
Western Union
"Oh, Western Union clickety clack"
I had a fight with my baby
Ooh how sorry I am
She won't talk to me no how
I'm gonna send a telegram
Western Union oh yeah
Send my loving baby back to me
She won't open my letters
She won't answer the phone
When I'm a-ringing her doorbell
She says there ain't nobody home
I love you is my message
Just three words and no more
If she won't let you deliver
Slip it underneath her door
"I wanna soothe my my heart, I wanna ease my mind"
I wanna move my shoes and see what I can find
I wanna stand up tall and open up my eyes
I wanna reach out my hand until I touch the skies
I was a poor lost lamb in a deep dark hole
But now I've found that light I'm gonna save my soul
"I used to drink, I used to smoke"
"I used to smoke, drink and dance the hoochy-coo"
"I used to smoke and drink, smoke and drink and dance the hoochy-coo"
Oh yeah and now I'm standing on this corner praying for me and you
I-I-I that's why I'm saved I'm saved
People let me tell you 'bout kingdom come
You know I'm saved I'm saved
Well I can preach until you're deaf and dumb
I'm in that soul saving army beating on that big bass drum
"I used to cuss, I used to fuss"
"I used to fuss, cuss, boogie all night long"
"I used to cuss and fuss, cuss and fuss"
Cuss and fuss and boogie all night long
"Well, now I'm standing on this corner, I know right from wrong"
"I used to lie, I used to cheat"
"I used to lie, cheat, steal from people's feet"
"I used to lie and cheat, lie and cheat and steal from people's feet"
"Well, now I'm stepping on to glory salvation in my beat"
"Because I'm saved, I'm saved"
I am saved I'm saved
"Well, I can preach until you're deaf and dumb"
"Oh yeah, because I'm saved, I'm saved"
"I'm saved, I'm saved I'm saved"
"Who are you, who am I?"
Are we more than strangers passing by?
Is this your dream are you in mine?
Are we really here or lost in time?
Will you be friend or lover
Show me the heart you conceal
Now is the time to discover
If this feeling we're feeling is real
So close to love and yet so far
Just one kiss will tell us who we are
Nothingville
Born in a two bit town
Where nothing's real
They treat me like a country clown in
I ain't gonna keep a-hanging 'round
While doors keep slamming in my face
People keep putting me in my place
It's a rat's race at a snail's pace
"Nothingville, Nothingville"
There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land
Where all my brothers walk hand in hand
"Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true, oh why"
There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong winds of promise that will blow away
The doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope keeps shining on everyone
"Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear"
We're lost in a cloud
With too much rain
We're trapped in a world
That's troubled with pain
But as long as a man
Has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly
Deep in my heart there's a trembling question
Still I am sure that the answers
Answers gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark
"There's a beckoning candle, yeah"
"And while I can think, while I can talk"
"While I can stand, while I can walk"
While I can dream
Oh please let my dream
Come true
Right now
Let it come true right now
Oh yeah
This is a wonderful day
It's as bright as a day's ever been
There is a big yellow sun looking down
On a wonderful scene
Up in the blue sky birds fly
And sing our cares away
And out of each throat each note
Greets a wonderful day
There is the sound of a symphony
Carried along on the breeze
Even the flowers are swaying in time
With the leaves on the trees
Heaven is found right here on the earth
It surrounds us in the wonderful things all around
In this wonderful wonderful
Wonderful wonderful world
"Wonderful world, this wonderful world"
"Hello, misfortune, how's my old friend ""Mr. Misery""?"
I've been away so long
I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me
I got no bed to rest my head
No doors or walls or window pane
Now all I needed was the rain
"Rain, rain, rain, rain"
Met a little honey
"At the Buzzing Bumble Bee Cafe, yes, I did"
One drink and all my money
And that honey bee had flown away
I'm 'bout as low as I can go
I don't really mean to complain
All I needed was this rain
All I needed was the rain
When you say that's it boy
I'm finally beat
You're going ninety miles an hour
Down a dead end street
You don't want to fight no more
You think that you can't win
Come on boy take a real deep breath
Jump right in and
Hold your head up high
Oh you got to be strong
"Come on and sing, sing, sing"
There is nothing like a song
Now they may take away your job
Take your fancy car
"They may repossess your clothes, take that fine guitar"
They may take everything you own
Well that's just for today
As long as you've got a song in your heart
Tomorrow's gonna be O.K
There is nothing going to stop you
Once you've set your mind
The only people going to knock you
Are jealous of what they find
Just keep a smile right on your face
Don't let them get you down
When you wake up tomorrow
The world is spinning round
"Hold your head up high, hey, hey, hey"
"You gotta be strong, all right"
There ain't nothing like a song
Well lovin's all that I can give you
(Baby that's enough)
You ain't easy to satisfy
(Baby I ain't that tough)
Now hey little girl you're about the wildest
Thing I've ever seen
(When I'm with you baby I'm a lovin' machine)
Come on and kiss me honey
Oh you gotta be strong
"Come on and sing, sing"
"Come on and sing, (sing) sing"
"(sing) sing, (sing) sing"
Salesman talking to me tried to run me up a creek
"Says you can buy it, go on try it, you can pay me next week"
"Uh-uh, too much monkey business, too much monkey business"
Too much monkey business for me to be involved in
Oh-ho-ho
"Blonde haired, good looking trying to get me hooked"
"Wants me to marry, settle down and get a home and and write a book"
"Pay phone, something wrong, dial gone"
Well me ought to sue the operator for telling me a tale
Oh-ho-ho  Oh-ho-ho  Oh-ho-ho  Oh-ho-ho
"Been to Vietnam, been a fighting in the war"
"Army bar, army chow, army clothes, army car"
"Working in the filling station, too many tasks"
"Wipe the window, check the tires, check the oil, dollar gas"
"Wants me to marry, get a home, settle down and and write a book"
"Too much monkey business, Oh-ho-ho, too much monkey business, Oh-ho-ho"
"Too much monkey business, Oh-ho-ho too much monkey business, Oh-ho-ho"
"I said I'd hold, I said I'd hold"
I said I'd hold you in my heart 'till I can hold you in my arms
Like you've never been held before
Well I'll think of you each day and then I'll dream the night away
"Oh, 'till you are in my arms once more"
"The stars up in the sky, you know they know the reason why"
I feel so blue cause I'm away from you
Yeah I'll hold you in my heart 'till I can hold you in my arms
Oh darling please wait for me
"You know the stars up in the sky, you know they know the reason why"
"I feel so blue cause I'm away, I'm away from you"
The stars up in the sky you know they know the reason why...
"I feel so blue cause I'm away, I'm away, I'm away, I'm away from you"
"I said, I said I'd hold you in my heart, heart, heart 'till I can hold you in my arms"
"I, I feel so blue cause I'm away, I'm away from you"
"Yeah, I'll hold you in my heart 'till I can hold you in my arms"
There's a long line of mourners
Driving down our little street
Their fancy cars
"Are such a sight to see, oh, yeah"
They're all of your rich friends
Who knew you in the city
And now they've finally brought you
Brought you home to me
"When you left, you know you told me"
That some day you'd be returning
In a fancy car
"All the town to see, oh, yeah"
"Well, now everyone is watching you"
You finally had your dream
"Yeah, and you're riding"
(You're riding)
In a long black limousine
"You know the papers told of how you lost your life, oh, yeah"
"The party, the party and the fatal crash that night"
"Well, the race upon the highway, oh, the curve you didn't see"
"Well, you're riding in that long black limousine"
(You're riding in that long black limousine)
Through tear filled eyes I watch
"As you ride by, oh, yeah"
A chauffeur
A chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine
"Well, I'll never, I'll never love another"
"Oh, my heart, all my dreams"
"Yeah, they're with you"
In that long black limousine
"Yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine"
"Oh, baby, I'm gonna teach you what love's all about tonight"
Trust me honey everything's gonna be all right
Just do like I do there ain't nothing to it
"Listen to me, baby, anybody can do it"
All you gotta do is just
Let yourself go
"Now don't be afraid, just relax and take it real slow"
"Cool it, baby, you ain't got no place to go"
Just put your arms around me real tight
"Enjoy yourself, baby, don't fight"
All you need is just a little rehearsal
The first thing that you know
You'll be ready for the grand finale
"So come on, baby, let's go"
"Let's go, let's go, let's go"
Let's go
Take a real deep breath and put your warm red lips on mine
"Just do like I tell you, everything's gonna be just fine"
"Kiss me nice and easy, take your time"
"Baby, I'm the only one here in line"
Let yourself go right now Yeah! let yourself go
Yeh! let yourself go
All you gotta do is just let yourself go
That big eight-wheeler runnin' down the track
Mean your true lovin' Daddy ain't comin' back
"'Cause he's Moving on, he's rolling on"
You were flying' too high for my little old sky
So I'm moving' on
"But some day, baby, when you've had your play"
Your gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
"Keep moving on, keep rolling on"
You were flying too high for my little old sky
"So I'm moving on, move on, baby"
"Mr. Fireman, won't you please listen to me?"
'Cause I gotta pretty momma in Tennessee
"To keep rolling on, keep moving on"
"Please listen to me, let this rattler free"
"Keep moving on, move on, son, move on"
"Well, I told you, baby, from time to time"
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
"And now I'm moving on, I'm rolling on"
"I'm through with you, too bad you're blue"
"But I'm moving on, move on, baby, move on"
"I said, ""Move on"", I said, ""Move on"""
"Well, I'm through with you, too bad you're blue"
"I said, ""Move on"""
"Hey, hey, hey, move on, I said, ""Move on"""
"Hey, hey, I said, ""Move on"", I said, ""Move on"""
I'm through with you but too bad you're blue
"I said, ""Move on, move on, move on"""
"Oh break it, burn it, drag it all around"
"Twist it, turn it, you can't tear it down"
"Cos' every minute, every hour you'll be shaken"
By the strength and mighty power of my love
"Crush it, kick it, you can never win"
I know baby you can't lick it
I'll make you give in
"Every minute, every hour you'll be shaken"
"Baby I want you, you'll never get away"
My love will haunt you yes haunt you night and day
"Touch it, pound it, what good does it do"
There's just no stopping' the way I feel for you
"Yeh, yeh, baby I want you, you'll never get away"
"I said every minute, every hour you'll be shaken"
Oh the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl I love
Her eyes are even bluer than Texas skies above
Her heart's as big as Texas and wherever I may go
I'll remember her forever because I love her so
There are so many roses that bloom along the way
But my heart's in Amarillo and that's where it will stay
With the yellow rose of Texas so I'd better get there fast
'Cause I know I was her first love and I want to be her last
The eyes of Texas are upon you all the live long day
"The eyes of Texas are upon you, you cannot get away"
Do not think you can escape them at night or early in the morn
The eyes of Texas are upon you 'till Gabriel blows his horn
But now after loving you
What else is there to do?
"For honey, all the rest"
Is just gonna have to be second best
I know I'll go through life
Comparing her to you
That's cause I'm no good
I'm no good to anyone
After loving you
Your precious love cannot be erased
By just another woman with a pretty face
"And your memory, you know it will remain"
For it cannot be erased
Other loves may come along
They can't live up to you
I said I'm no good
I'm no good
"To anyone, to anyone, to anyone"
I'm no good to anyone after loving you
How many girls choose cotton dress worlds
When they could have satins and lace
And stand by her man
Never once letting shame touch her face
How many hearts could live through all the winters
We've known and still not be cold?
True love travels on a gravel road
Love is a stranger and hearts are in danger
On smooth streets paved with gold
"Oh, true love travels on a gravel road, oh"
Down through the years we've had hard times and tears
But they only helped our love grow
And we'll stay together no matter how strong the wind blows
Not once have I seen your blue eyes filled with envy
Or stray from the one that you hold
"Oh, true love travels on a gravel road"
"Yeah, true love travels on a gravel road"
Any day now I will hear you say
Goodbye my love
You'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird
You will have flown
Any day now
(Any day now)
I'll be all alone
(I'll be all alone)
"Any day now, when your restless eyes"
"Meet someone new, to my sad surprise"
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town
Love will let me down
(Love will let me down)
I know I shouldn't want to keep you
"If you don't want to stay, yeah"
Until you've gone forever
I'll be holding on for dear life
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay
Any day now when the clock strikes go
"You'll call it off, then my tears will flow"
"(Any day now, any day now)"
And you won't be around
"Any day now, any day now"
"Don't fly away, my beautiful bird"
"Any day now, don't fly away"
As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago morning
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another little hungry mouth to feed
"People, don't you understand"
A child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way
Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
"He buys a gun, He steals a car"
"Tries to run, but he don't get far"
As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
And as her young man dies
Another little baby child is born
From a jack to a king of loneliness to a wedding ring
I've played an ace and I won the queen
I walked away with your heart
From a jack to a king
"With no regrets I stacked, I stacked the cards, I stacked the cards last night"
And lady luck played her hand just right
You made me king of your heart
Oh for just a little while I thought that I might lose the game
Oh but just in time I saw that twinkle in your eyes
"From a jack to a king of loneliness to a wedding, wedding, wedding ring"
I played an ace and I won the queen
Do you know who I am?
Have you had any idea who I am?
"Yes, it's been quite a while"
And it's so good to see you again
It's so dark in this place
That I can't see your face
May believe Oh I see
Does he know who I am
And what once was between you and me?
Do you know how I tried?
Have you any idea how I tried
Not to keep you in sight
Do you know darling how much I cried?
I remember you said
"That you had to forget about me, and be free"
Do you know who I am or have you forgot about me?
Do you think there's a chance
You and I could start over again
Is there a prayer you still care
Or has it just been too long and we're through?
"Well, what about you and him?"
Oh he's only a friend
Well I see there's still a chance for me
"Well maybe some other time, in some other place"
With our love in your heart and a smile on your face
You will know who I am
When that time comes you'll know who I am
"Listen easy, you can hear God calling"
Walking barefoot by the stream
"Come on to me, Your hair's softly falling"
On my face as in a dream
And the time will be our time
And the grass won't pay no mind
"Saying nothing, lying where the sun is"
Baking down upon our sides
"My lips touch you, with their soft wet kisses"
Your hands gentle in reply
"Child, touch my soul with your cries"
And the music will know what we've found
"I, hear a hundred good-byes"
But today I hear only one sound
The moment we're living is now
Now now now now now now now
"Young bird flying, and a soft wind blowing"
Cools the sweat inside my palms
"Close my eyes, hear the flowers growing"
As you lay sleeping in my arms
No the grass won't pay no mind
I am the king of the jungle
They call me Tiger Man
If you cross my path
You take your own life in your hands
"Yeah, I get up on a mountain"
And I call my bear cat back
My bear cat comes running
And the hound dogs they stay way back
"Way back, way back, way back"
Trace their way back
"Yeah, well, I get up on a mountain"
But the hound dogs trace their way back
I'm like a stranger
Like a stranger in my own home town
My so called friends stopped being friendly
Oh but you can't keep a good man down
"Oh no, can't get him down"
I came home with good intentions
About 5 or 6 years ago
But my home town won't accept me
Just don't feel welcome here no more
My home town won't accept me
"About 5 or 6 years ago, yes I did"
"I'm like a stranger, like a stranger in my own home town"
"Yeah, I'm like a stranger, like a stranger in my own home town"
"I play the song, it was our own"
Your photograph's by my side
I know I can't forget you
So I don't even try
The note you left is in my hand
I read again what you say
You're sorry but you love him
And you've both gone away
This is the story of a man
Whose world has fallen apart
And it's the story
That is breaking my heart
"An open fire, our favorite chair"
I get a book from the shelf
But the words I am reading
Could apply to myself
"Yes, it's the story that is breaking my heart"
I can't stop loving you
"I said  I've made up my mind, yes I did"
To live in memory
"Of such an lone-, lonely time"
And I can't stop wanting you
"I said It's useless to say, yes I did"
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday
Those happy hours
All that we once knew
Though long ago
They still make me blue
They say that time
It heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart
"So I've made up my mind, yes I did"
"I said it's useless to say, yes I did"
"Well, my baby don't stand no cheating, my babe"
"Well, my babe don't stand no cheating"
"She don't, she don't, she don't, oh, Lord"
"My babe, I know she loves me, my babe"
"Well, now my babe, I know she loves me, my babe"
"Yeah, my baby, I know she loves me, my babe"
"Well, my baby, I know she loves me"
She don't do nothing but kiss and hug me
"Oh my, my baby"
(Oh baby)
"Well, well, my babe, I know she loves"
"She don't, she don't, she don't"
God bless the day I found you
I want to stay around you
And so I beg you
Let it be me
Don't take this Heaven from one
Well if you must cling to someone
Now and forever
Each time we meet love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love
"Tell me, what would life be?"
So never leave me lonely
Just tell me you love me only
And that you'll always
Tell me you love me only
"If I could be you, if you could be me"
For just one hour
If we could find a way to get inside
Each other's mind
If you could see you through my eyes
Instead of your ego
"I believe you'd be, I believe you'd be surprised to see"
That you've been blind
Walk a mile in my shoes
"Yeah, before you abuse, criticize and accuse"
Now if we spend the day
Throwing stones at one another
"'Cause I don't think,  'cause I don't think I wear my hair the same way you do"
"Well, I may be common people"
But I'm your brother
When you strike out
To try to hurt me
It's hurtin' you
Lord have mercy
Now there are people on reservations
And out in the ghetto
"And brother there, but for the grace of god"
Go you and me
If I only had the wings
Of a little angel
"Don't you know, I'd fly to the top of a mountain"
"And then I'd cry, cry, cry"
Left a good job in the city
Working for the man every night and day
Haven't ever lost one minute of sleeping
Worried about the way things might have been
A big wheel keep on turning
Proud Mary keep on b-b-b-burning
"Rolling, Rolling, Rollin on a river"
"Rollin, Rollin, Rollin on a river"
Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of 'pane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen
If you come down to the river
I betcha you're going to find some people who live
You don't have to worry
Because you have no money
People along the river are happy to give
"I said see, see, see rider"
"Oh, see what you have done"
"Oh girl, you made me love you"
"Now, now, now your loving man has gone"
Hear what I say
"Well, I'm going away, baby"
And I won't be back till fall
"Well, I'm going away baby"
And if I find me a good girl
"I won't, I won't be back at all"
"Hear what I say, I said"
See see rider
Oh see what you have done
"Now once it was told to me, we're born with a magic key"
It opens the door to miracles of spring
"It takes you to wishing wells, to ice cream and carousels"
And yet this magic key won't unlock a thing
"Unless you have a happy, you have a happy"
"Have a happy, warm smiling face"
"I start believing, in believing"
Let your address be sunshine place
There's love and there's joy I'm told
Much more than your heart can hold
It's there like the ring you'd grab on a merry-go-round
The world isn't half as gray with friends on a rainy day
"But people keep away when you wear a frown, you've got"
"To have a happy, you have a happy"
Have a happy warm smiling face
"Start believing, in believing"
I've been standing on a corner
Since a quarter after seven
I was down to my last cigarette
And the clock in the window
At a quarter to eleven
I was watching all the people
Passing by me going places
Just the loneliest guy in the town
Looking for a friendly smile
But all I see were faces
"And then, just like the taste of milk and honey"
I found the stranger I've been looking for
"Like a wave, my cup of love was overflowing"
I knew the stranger in the crowd
And I would be stranger no more
Love had found us on that corner
I thought you were too good to be true
All my life I had believed
That angels only live in heaven
"But now, we share the taste of milk and honey"
Each day is sweeter than the day before
My cup ran overflowing
Because the stranger in the crowd
"Deep inside, my cup of love was overflowing"
Lying by your side I watch you sleeping
And in your face the sweetness of a child
Murmuring the dreams you won't recapture
Though it will haunt the corners of you mind
"Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you"
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling
Who can tell when summer turns to autumn
And who can point the moment love grows cold
Softly without pain the joy is over
Though why it's gone will neither of us know
"But reason can't stand in for feeling, oh"
Six o'clock the baby will be crying
"And you will stumble, sleeping to the door"
In the chill and solemn gray of morning
We play the parts that we have learned too well
"I've lost you yes, I've lost you"
"When I said, I needed you"
You said you would always stay
"It wasn't me who changed, but you"
And now you've gone away
But don't you know that now you're gone
And I'm left here on my own
Now I have to follow you
And beg you to come home
You don't have to say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever
I will understand
"Believe me, believe me"
That you don't have to love me
"But believe me, I'll never tie you down"
Left alone just a memory
Life seems dead and so unreal
All that's left is loneliness
There's nothing left to feel
"Believe me, oh believe me"
"Oh, you don't have to say you love me"
"Believe me, believe me, oh believe me"
Oh you tell me that you love me
Yes you tell me that you care
"That tomorrow we'll be married, oh"
But tomorrow's never there
"Oh tomorrow never, never comes"
Oh tomorrow never comes
"Now you tell me that you love me, oh"
But tomorrow never comes
Many weeks now have I waited
Oh many long nights have I cried
"But just to see that happy morning, happy morning"
When I have you right by my side
"But tomorrow will never come, oh no, no"
Tomorrow never going to come
Now you tell me that you love me
"But tomorrow never, never comes"
So tomorrow I'll be leaving
Yes tomorrow I'll be gone
"But tomorrow you'll be weeping, oh"
"But tomorrow will never, never come"
"Well tomorrow will never, never come"
"Oh no, tomorrow ain't never going to come"
"Yeah, yeah, you tell me, you tell me"
"That you love me, but tomorrow never comes"
Tonight I'm alone without you my dear
It seems that there's a longing for you still
Oh but I just keep it there so I won't be alone
In our little cabin on the hill
Oh someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
To listen to the rain beat on our window pane
Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the morning
When through the sleepy haze I see her lying there
Soft as the rain that falls on summer flowers
Warm as the sunlight shining on her head
When I awake and see her there so close beside me
I want to take her in my arms
The ache is there so deep inside me
Chasing the rainbow in her dreams so far away
And when she turns to touch me I kiss her face so softly
And then my Mary wakes to love and love again
And Mary's there in summer days or stormy weather
She doesn't care how right or wrong the love we share
We share together
Nothing's quite as pretty as Mary in the evening
Kissed by the shade of night and starlight in her hair
"And as we walk, I hold her close beside me"
All our tomorrows for a lifetime we will share
We've got to patch it up baby
Before we fall apart at the seams
We can't let time unravel our dreams
Let's go back and touch the past
One more night is all I ask
"Get that feeling, that old feeling, feelin-eelin'"
We can patch it up baby
Patch it up with a whole lotta' love
We got to patch it up baby
Let's sweep out all the cobwebs in our hearts
Before indifference pulls us apart
Don't let a good love die
Lets give it just one more try
"With that feeling, that old feeling, feelin-eelin'"
I left my home up in the hills far behind me
"I left my wife with unpaid bills, she can't find me"
"I'm trying out the world for size, find that it's not paradise, it's lonely"
Now for twenty days and twenty nights I've been alone
And that ain't right
Without her
"City ways are strange to me, I can't make it"
"For it's not like it ought to be, and I can't take it"
"I've got to face the truth one day, man can't always run away from trouble"
"No, now for twenty days and twenty nights I've been a fool"
"One day soon I'm going back, where she still minds me"
"I've been out of line and off the track, but that's behind me"
"I fooled around and did it well, but I just couldn't ring the bell , without her, no"
It's taken twenty days and twenty nights to prove me wrong and make her right
"Twenty days and twenty nights I was wrong and she was right, all along"
"Oh, I miss her"
"Oh, how I miss her, oh how I miss her, oh how I miss her"
I just can't help believing
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty morning
And a promise of tomorrow in her eyes
When she's lying close beside me
And my heart beats with the rhythm of her sighs
This time the girl is going to stay
For more than just a day
"Oh, I just can't help believing"
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
And my fingers fold around it like a glove
When she's whispering her magic
And her tears are shining honey sweet with love
When she smiles and whisper her magic
There goes my only possession
There goes my everything
I hear footsteps slowly walking
As they gently walk across the lonely floor
And a voice is softly saying
Darling this will be goodbye for evermore
There goes my reason for living
There goes the one of my dreams
As my memory turns back the pages
I can see the happy years we've had before
Now the love that kept this old heart beating
Has been shattered by the closing of the door
"Gather round me buddy, raise your glasses high"
"And drink to a fool, a crazy fool"
Who told his baby goodbye
Too late he found he loved her so much he wants to die
"So drink to a fool, a crazy fool"
"He needs her, he needs her so"
He wonders why he let her go
"She's found, she's found, she's found"
"A new love buddy, he's a lucky guy"
As I read the letters that you wrote to me
"Well it's you, it's you that I'm thinking of"
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love
I miss you darling more and more everyday
As heaven would miss the stars above
"With every heartbeat, I still think of you"
And remember our faded love
"As I think of the past, all the pleasures that we had"
As I watch the mating of the doves
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye
I was born in Macon Georgia
They kept my daddy over in Macon jail
He told me if you keep your hands clean
You won't hear them bloodhounds on your trail
Well I fell in with bad companions
"Robbed a man, oh up in Tennessee"
They caught me way up in Nashville
They locked me up and threw away the key
I washed my hands in muddy water
"Washed my hands, but they didn't come clean"
Tried to do what my daddy told me
But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream
Well I asked the judge now when's my time up
"He said son, oh you know we won't forget"
If you try just to keep your hands clean
We might just make a good man of you yet
Oh I couldn't wait to get my time up
"I broke out, broke out of Nashville jail"
I just crossed the state-line of Georgia
Well I can hear those bloodhounds on my trail
Make the world go away
Get it off my shoulder
Say the things we used to say
"And make the world, make it go away"
Do you remember when you loved me
Before the world took you away
"Well if you do, then forgive me"
Now I'm sorry if I hurt you
Let me make it up to you day by day
And if you will please forgive me
Come on everybody and snap your fingers now
Come on everybody clap your hands real loud
Come on everybody take a real deep breath
And repeat after me
Loving my baby
"Hey, hey, hey and my baby loves me"
Come on everybody and whistle this tune right now
Come on everybody and stomp your feet real loud
Well there ain't nothing wrong with the long-haired music
"Like Brahms, Beethoven and Bach"
Well I was raised with a guitar in my hand
And I was born to rock
"Well, come on everybody and turn your head to the left"
Come on everybody and turn your head to the right
Your lips were made for kisses so tender
I'm almost in love tonight
"When we are close, my heart says surrender"
And here under the spell of evening
I long to hold you tight
"Heaven is near, why think of tomorrow"
It may be just the spell of evening
Almost in love
"Angel, with those angel eyes"
Come and take this earth boy
Up to paradise
"Angel, may I hold you tight?"
Never kissed an angel
Let me kiss one tonight
"If I said ""I love you"""
Would I be speaking out of turn?
"I'm only human, but I'm willing to learn"
"Angel, make my wish come true"
Let me be in heaven here on earth with you
"Angel, never kissed an angel"
"Easy come, easy go"
"Here, there, everywhere"
Crazy love is in the air
"Nightfall, mm, day and nightfall"
So many girls in every port
You got to be a juggernaut
Full speed ahead or you'll be caught
"Oh yeah, oh yeah"
"Up, down, all around, kiss and kiss"
"And pound for pound, delicious"
"Mm, so nutritious"
Sailor beware take it slow
"Easy come, easy go, all right"
When you want love to keep you warm
There's nothing like a uniform
You got a port in any storm
There she blows
"I walk along a thin line, darling"
Dark shadows follow me
Here's where life's dream lies disillusioned
The edge of reality
"Oh, I can hear strange voices echo"
Laughing with mockery
The border line of doom I'm facing
On the edge of reality she sits there tormenting me
The girl with the nameless face
On the edge of reality where she overpowers me
With fears that I can't explain
She drove me to the point of madness
The brink of misery
If she's not real then I'm condemned to
"Reality, reality, reality, reality"
My warped and worried mind resorts
To wandering off to ponder things I never talk about
A pretty girl I used to know
But wouldn't know if we met face to face
And defying every logic known
I wish the time machine could take me back again
"To the wonder of my first love, the old folks tease me 'bout"
Referring to her only as my little friend
Somewhere far away and maybe not so far away
A child has grown into a woman of the world
I assume this knowing that she knew so much of life
At such a tender age
I learned from her the whispered things
The big boys at the pool hall talk about
The thrill and disappointment
Fear and shame that first love brings
"But oh, how I thought I loved my little friend"
The fragrance of the green grass
Mingled with the scent of love and warming earth
The moonlight night I kissed and cried
And swore I'd never touch another girl
But time moved fast and I moved on
And I loved others time and time again
But with each time I thought of her
And always gave a little more
Assembled love and remembrance for my little friend
"Oh-oh-oh assembled love, remembrance for my little friend"
"A little less conversation, a little more action please"
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Satisfy me baby
Baby close your eyes and listen to the music
Drifting through a summer breeze
It's a groovy night and I can show you how to use it
Come along with me and put your mind at ease
Shut your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
Come on baby I'm tired of talking
Grab your coat and let's start walking
"Come on, come on"
"Don't procrastinate, don't articulate"
"Girl it's getting late, gettin' upset waitin' around"
Satisfy me
Back porch preacher preaching at me
Acting like he wrote the golden rule
Shaking his fist and speeching at me
Shouting from his soap box like a fool
Come Sunday morning he's lying in bed
"With his eye all red, with the wine in his head"
Wishing he was dead when he oughta be
Heading for Sunday school
Clean up your own backyard
Oh don't you hand me none of your lines
"You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine"
Drugstore cowboy criticizing
Acting like he's better than you and me
Standing on the sidewalk supervising
Telling everybody how they ought to be
Come closing time 'most every night
He locks up tight and out go the lights
And he ducks out of sight and he cheats on his wife
With his employee
Armchair quarterback's always moaning
Second guessing people all day long
"Pushing, fooling and hanging on in"
Always messing where they don't belong
When you get right down to the nitty-gritty
Isn't it a pity that in this big city
Not a one a'little bitty man'll admit
He could have been a little bit wrong
A poor man wants the oyster
A rich man wants the pearl
But the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world
"Come on let's sing, sing brother sing"
'Cos the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
The rich man wants the princess
The poor man just wants a girl
A poor man wants to be a rich man
A rich man wants to be a king
Of the whole wide world
Some people think that pot of gold
Is all they ever want to hold
"But there's a treasure, I think more of"
Measure for measure  I'll take love
Some people think that their success
Is all they need for happiness
"But there's a pleasure, I think more of"
Pound for pound oh yeah and
Ounce for ounce love is all that really counts
So let them have their wealth and fame
Eat caviar and drink champagne
You're all the treasure I'm dreaming of
"I'll take love, I'll take love"
"I give, give you my heart"
"Today, tomorrow and forever"
You'll always be my love
I vow we'll never part
Long as there's stars above
The cares of life will fade away
As long as we're together
"So stay, stay in my arms"
Show me a girl with a dimple on her cheek
But it melts in her mouth when she opens it to speak
Show me a girl who is acting so refined
And I'll show you a girl with one thing on her mind
"So I say, ""You know what?"""
"She says, ""What?"", I say, ""What?"
"Oh, I'm not the marrying kind"""
"""For you've got what it takes"
And it takes what you've got
"But I'm not the marrying kind"""
"""Don't kiss me, don't claw me"
"Don't pet me, don't paw me"
"I won't leave my freedom behind"""
"""You know what?"", She says, ""What?"""
"I say, ""What? Thanks a lot"
"""I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not"
Now you've got what I'm not
"I'm not the marrying kind"""
"""Oh, I'm not the marrying kind"
This is living
Full of fun and free
That's the life for me
It's good to laugh and sing
Don't worry about a thing
Wear a happy smile
Cut loose and run a mile
If you relax and just enjoy it all
Life has got to be a ball
It wouldn't mean a thing
If I could be a king
I really wouldn't care
To be a millionaire
I'd rather find someone to love a lot
Live and give it all I've got
Don't want to settle down
I got to move around
I got to lot of time
I'm going to wait and find
The kind of girl who's heart is restless too
The kind who feels the way I do
"O come, all ye faithful"
Joyful and triumphant
"O come ye, o come ye to Bethlehem"
Come and behold him
Born the king of angels
O come let us adore him
Christ the lord
Sing choirs of angels
Sing in exaltation
Oh sing all ye rivals
Of heaven above
"Glory to god, glory in the highest"
Somewhere out in empty space
Long before the human race
Something stirred
A vast and timeless source began
Intelligence was born and then
There was the Word
Powers filled the universe
Matter formed and broke the curse
Of nothingness
Love became an ageless soul
Nature reached her highest goal
And breathed the breath of life
Everlasting life
"Well, creatures come from out of sight"
Daylight came from in the night
And all was good
Life became a master plan
Love produced a perfect man
That understood
The image of the Maker's word
Worshiped him with all he had
But then one day
From in the depths an evil seed
Grew and manufactured greed
That changed the way of life
"Oh, the loving power looked and saw"
Inside the heart of man a flaw
Began to grow
"Well, the fires of Hell began to burn"
And so He sent his chosen son
To let us know
That love had surely made us all
And hate would surely make us fall
So from the cross
Well He showed the world that dreadful day
That love could be the only way
Or all is lost of life
For life is love
And love is life
How many stars are in the sky
I'll never know
What fire lights a firefly
What happens to this heart of mine
Each time you hold my hand
Sometimes the things we love the most
We never understand
I never thought these eyes would see
An angel's glow
What miracle brought you to me
Wish I was an apple dangling from a tree
Every time you'd pass me by you'd take a bite of me
"I wish I was a bluebird, I'd never fly away"
"I'd sit up on your shoulder, baby, and sing to you all day"
"Come on home Cindy, Cindy"
Come on home to me
"I wrote it in a letter, carved it on a tree"
"Told it to a honeycomb, told it to a bee"
"Told them that I love you, they all know it's true"
"Say it till the cows come home, until it gets to you"
Need you in the morning to start the coffee pot
Need you in the afternoon to fan me when I'm hot
Need you in the evening when supper time is through
What I'm really trying to say is I can't get enough of you
If I were a musician I'd harp on just one thing
You should never play my harp the way you pluck a string
"If only you would love me, sincerely tell me so"
I'd beat two drums about it baby to have the whole world know
The wonderful world of Christmas
Is a wonderful world to behold
Was made for the young and the old
Smile and good cheer of each neighbor
And children with cheeks all aglow
"So, warm is this Christmassy feeling"
With the tree tops all locked up with snow
Listen to those wondrous bells
And you'll hear them say
Open up your hearts to all on this holiday
Is a joy from the moment it starts
Shall remain every day in our hearts
"(Open up your hearts to all, to the wonderful world of Christmas)"
"Hands off of her, she belongs to me"
Mojo working don't belong to you
"Well, she's mine all mine no matter what you do"
"Play it boys, play it boys"
I got my mojo working but it just don't work on you
But you're mine all mine no matter what you do
Let me tell you now
"She's long lean and lanky, sweet as she can be"
Hands off of her' don't belong to you
Well she's mine all mine no matter what you do
Well you're mine all mine no matter what you do
"Play it Jerry, play it"
"No matter what you do, play it son"
"Well she's long lean and lanky, sweet as she can be"
Hands off of her unless you want to deal with me
I got my mojo working I got my mojo working
"Well, you're mine all mine no matter what you do"
One more time!
Listen to me now
I said you're long lean and lanky cute as you can be
"Get your hands off of her, she doesn't belong to you"
"Yeah, I got my mojo working I got my mojo working"
"Somewhere in, in the distant night"
I hear Christmas bells
The gentle snow keeps falling down on people
Who are homeward bound
That's the way it's always been
The circle really never ends
Christmas seems to come and go
Home's a place that I don't know
Holly leaves and Christmas trees
It's that time of year
Lights aglow and mistletoe
Don't mean a thing when you're not here
"As I walk, walk this lonely street"
The sound of snow beneath my feet
"I'll think of how, how it used to be"
Used to mean so much to me
(Holly leaves and Christmas trees)
The Sandman comes to my house late each night
But it's way in the morning before he turns out my life
It's times like this my darling I can see
If I were you I'd know that I love me
The great snowman I've been called by all
But it looks like this time I'm going to fall
Ooh If I were you I'd know that I love me
Wind and rain and storm closing in on me
I've walked the streets alone with my self sympathy
Can you hear me saying hopefully
"Merry, merry Christmas, baby"
Sure did treat me nice
"I said merry Christmas, baby"
Gave me diamond rings for Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise
"Well, I'm feeling mighty fine"
Got good music on my radio
"Well, I want to kiss you, baby"
While you're standing 'neath the mistletoe
"I said, merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas, baby"
"You sure did treat me nice, yes, you did"
"Yes, you did, yes, you did, yes, you did"
"I said merry, merry Christmas baby"
"I said, merry, merry, merry Christmas, baby"
You sure did treat me nice
"I said, merry, merry Christmas, baby"
"Girl, you sure did treat me nice"
Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
Now I'm putting it through Al's mike
"Got good music on my, on my radio"
Underneath your mistletoe
Shackled by a heavy burden
Need the Lord again and shame
Then the hand of Jesus touched me
And now I am no longer the same
For he touched me
He touched me
And what a wonderful joy
Joy that foods my soul
Something happened and now I know
And made me whole
Oh since I met this blessed Savior
And since he cleansed and made me whole
Oh I never cease
Never cease to praise Him
I'll shout it while eternity rolls
When trouble is in my way
I can't tell the night from day
I toss from side to side
Like a ship on a raging tide
I don't worry and I don't fret
God has never failed me yet
Trouble's coming from time to time
But that's all right
Cause I'm not the worrying kind
"Because I, I've got confidence"
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know he's gonna fix it for me
Job was so sick so long
Till the flesh fell from his bones
"His wife, cattle and children"
Everything that he had was gone
But Job he never despaired
He knew that God still cared
Sleepless days and sleepless nights
"Job said ""Honey, that's all right"""
Some folks wonder how I smile
Even though I'm going to trial
How can I have a song
Everything is going wrong
"That's all right, I'm not the worrying kind"
Cause I've got confidence
I saw old pharaoh's daughter bring Moses from the water
I'll lick the guy that says it isn't so
I was born about ten thousand years ago
There is nothing in this world that I don't know
I saved king David's life and he offered me a wife
I said now you're talking business have a chair
"Yeah, I was born about ten thousand years ago"
"Saw Peter, Paul and Moses playing ring around the roses"
I was there when old Noah built the ark
And I crawled in the window after dark
I saw Jonah eat the whale and dance with the lion's tail
And I crossed over Canaan on a log
I saw Jonah eat the whale and Daniel twist the lion's tail
"Oh, Amazing grace, oh how sweet the sound"
That saved a wretch like me
"I once was lost, but now I'm found"
"Was blind, but now I see"
When we've been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We've no less days to sing God's praise
"Then when, when we first begun"
"Through many dangers, toils and snares"
I have already come
Tis Grace has brought me safe thus far
And Grace will lead me home
"Amazing grace, oh how sweet the sound"
To save a wretch like me
Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head
Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me
Then I don't care
"Oh, oh, oh, oh"
Where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know
When we met
I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let
This fool rush in
And I don't care
I long to be His possession
"Oh, He is my everything"
I remember my days of darkness
Without sunshine or sight to lead the way
But a whisper of His voice softly calling
To the arms of my Maker to stay
He is my reason for living
Oh He is the king of all kings
After the lighting and thunder
After the last bell has rung
I want to bow down before Him
And hear Him say well done
These long lonely evenings
Here I am on the phone
Wondering if she will call
She said she would write me
Because she knows I'm alone
But I hear nothing at all
I'm waiting for a word of love from Sylvia
You think she'd never heard of love my Sylvia
"But when I'm with her Lord, I forgive her"
Because she's more than the whole world to me
There's nothing like a word of love from Sylvia
The only one I'm thinking of is Sylvia
"Feeling so sad now, I'll be so glad now"
If I just had my Sylvia with me
That old weeping willow
Seems to whisper her name
Why did she go away
The tears on my pillow
They're not hard to explain
There's nothing else I can say
"You're not a dream, you're not an angel, you're a woman"
"I'm not a king, just a man, take my hand"
We'll make a space in this lives that we planned
And here we'll stay until it's time for you to go
"Yes, we're different worlds apart, we're not the same"
"We laughed and played at the start like in a game, oh Lord"
You could have stayed outside my heart but in you came
And here you'll stay until it's time for you to go
Don't ask why
Don't ask how
Don't ask forever
"Lord love me, love me, love me, love me now"
"This love of mine has no beginning, it has no end"
I was an oak now I'm a willow and I can bend
And tho' I'll never in my life see you again
Here I stay until it's time for you to go
"Oh yes, I'll stay until it's time for you to go"
Oh Blessed Mother we pray to Thee
Thanks for the miracle of Your Rosary
Only You can hold back
Your Holy Son's hand
Long enough for the whole world to understand
Hail Mary full of grace
The Lord is with Thee
Blessed are thou among women
"And blessed is the fruit of Thy womb, Jesus"
Oh Holy Mary dear Mother of God
Please pray for us sinners
Now and at the hour of our death
And give thanks once again
For the miracle of Your Rosary
"Well, that's all right, mama"
That's all right for you
"That's all right mama, just anyway you do"
"Well, that's all right, that's all right"
"That's all right now mama, anyway you do"
"Well Mama, she done told me"
Papa done told me too
"Son, that girl you're fooling with"
She ain't no good for you
"But, that's all right, that's all right"
"I'm leaving town, baby"
I'm leaving town for sure
"Well, then you won't be bothered with"
Me hanging around your door
"But that's all right, that's all right"
"Ah da da dee dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee, dee dee dee dee"
I need your lovin'
That's all right
"Lead me oh Lord, won't you lead me"
I am tired and I need Thy strength and power
To guide me over my darkest hour
For just open my eyes that I may see
"Lead me, guide me along the way"
For if you lead me I cannot stray
Or just open my eyes that I may see
I am lost if you take your hand from me
I am blind without try light to see
Lord just always let me Thy servant be
Lord just open my eyes that I may see
"Fool, you didn't have to hurt her"
"Fool, you didn't have to lose her"
"Fool, you only had to love her"
But now her love is gone
"Fool, you could have made her want you"
"Fool, you could have made her love you"
Gone now the love and laughter
See yourself the morning after
Can't you see her eyes are misty
As she said goodbye
"Don't look so sad, I know it's over"
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning
Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops falling soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the Good times
"I'll get along, you'll find another"
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
For the good times
I am not a wise man neither am I a fool
"But what I am, the way the good Lord made me"
Though I need you more than you may ever understand
I can't wear a face that will betray me
"Oh, if you're gonna love me, love the life I lead"
"Need the things I need, don't try to change me"
"If you're gonna take me, take me for what I am"
"I can't be another man, I can't be free"
'Cos the life I lead is the life I lead
Money in my pocket never seems to last too long
I've gambled on the way and drowned my sorrows
"Though God knows, I can't pretend it's better on my own"
I can't promise you a new tomorrow
"If you're gonna love me, love the life I lead"
'Cos the life I
Oh I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times there are not forgotten
"Look away, look away, look away Dixieland"
"Oh I wish I was in Dixie, away, away"
In Dixieland I take my stand to live and die in Dixie
"Because Dixieland, that's where I was born"
Early Lord one frosty morning
"Glory, glory hallelujah"
His truth is marching on
So hush little baby
Don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
"But all my trials, Lord will soon be over"
"There is no God, but God"
I know this is true
God made everything
"He made me, He made you"
There'd be no birds
No planes to sail in the blue
Without his wondrous eyes
To see them through
They say God made land
And He gave it all to man
Yes I know He's mighty good and true
And He knows everything to do
So just you call on Him
And He will share His love with you
For God made everything
"It's impossible, tell the sun to leave the sky"
It's just impossible
It's impossible to ask a baby not to cry
Can I hold you closer to me?
And not feel you going through me
But the second that I never think of you?
"Oh, how impossible"
Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore?
"If I had you, could I ever ask for more?"
And tomorrow should you ask me for the world?
"Somehow I'd get it, I would sell my very soul"
And not regret it for to live without your love
Is just impossible
"Oh, impossible"
(Impossible)
Impossible
"Ooh, love, a thing called love"
"Six foot six he stood on the ground, he weighed 235 pounds"
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love
He was the kind of a man who would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love
"You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands"
But like the wind it covers our land
"Strong enough to rule the heart of many man, this thing called love"
"It can lift you up, never let you down"
Take your world and turn it all around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found that's stronger than love
Most men are like me they struggle and doubt
Trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with living to worry about a little word like love
But when I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I thank God that the world's been blessed
With a thing called love
That's what you get for loving me
"Everything we had is gone, you can see"
Now don't you shed a tear for me
I ain't the love you thought I'd be
I've had a hundred just like you
But don't be blue I'll have a thousand before I'm through
"Now there you go, you're cryin' again"
You should have known how things would end
But then some day when your poor heart is on the mend
I just might pass this way again
"I'll take you home again, Kathleen"
Across the ocean wild and wide
To where your heart has ever been
"Since first, you were my bonny bride"
The roses all have left your cheek
I watch them fade away and die
Your voice is soft whenever you speak
And tears bedim your lovely eye
"Oh, I will take you home, Kathleen"
To where your heart shall feel no pain
And when the fields are soft and green
"I will take you to your home, Kathleen"
Never found a four leaf clover
To bring good luck to me
"No rabbit's foot, no lucky star"
No magic wishing tree
"But I got lucky, yes, I got lucky"
"(I got lucky, lucky when)"
"When I found you, oh oh, yeah"
Got no rainbow around my shoulder
No horseshoe on my door
But I got you to hold me tight
And who could ask for more
"Oh, I got lucky, yes, I got lucky"
When I found you
(When I found you)
I always walk around
With all my fingers crossed
I'm afraid the love I found
Just might get lost
So won't you tell me that you love me
Hurry up and name the day
And then I'll know that my good luck
Is really here to stay
(I got lucky)
I will be true
No matter what they may say
"Although you're far, far away"
Each night I pray
All day I'll say silent prayers
That when I open my door
I'll find you there
Somehow I feel
That someday we'll meet again
Don't ask me how
It's something I can't explain
Until the day
I give up all hope of you
"Assure yourself this, I'll do"
Is your burden heavy as you bear it all alone?
"Does the road you travel, harbor dangers yet unknown?"
Are you growing weary in the struggle of it all?
Jesus will help you with all his name you call
"He's always there hearing every prayer, faithful and true"
"Walking by our side, in his love we hide all the day through"
When you get discouraged just remember what to do
"Reach out to Jesus, he's reaching out to you"
Is the life you're living filled with sorrow and despair?
Does the future press you with its worry and its scare?
"Are you tired and jealous, have you almost lost your way?"
"Jesus will help you, just talk to him today"
It's a wonderful life
This life I'm living
"What a wonderful life, living a life of ease, oh-ho-oh"
"Well, I've got no job to worry me"
No big bad boss to hurry me
It's a wonderful life life's good to me
It's a wonderful road
This road I'm traveling
"It's a wonderful road heading beyond the hills, oh-ho-oh"
Oh it may go straight or it may detour
But one thing that I know for sure
"It's a wonderful life, life's good to me"
Don't know where I'm going
Don't care where I'm going
Like the four winds are blowing I go on
"Laughing the day away, loving the night away"
Till the moon is gone
What a wonderful life
"Living the life I love, oh yeah"
"Well I've got neighbors, I've got friends"
Just about anywhere the rainbow ends
"What a wonderful life, life's good to me, yeah"
"Crazy life, life's good to me"
Oh what a life
I need somebody to lean on
"I need somebody to, to tell my troubles to"
"No use denying, I'm close to crying"
"But what good, tell me, what good would my crying do?"
I need somebody to help me
Help me forget all those worries on my mind
"And when I'm lonely, if someone would only"
Want to be sweet and kind
"I need somebody, won't that somebody"
"Please, please listen to my plea?"
"Need that somebody, won't that somebody"
Come running to me?
I'm tired of being unhappy and so blue
If she came I would hold her
"'Cause I need that shoulder to lean on, yes, I really do"
I need somebody and maybe that somebody is you
I'm riding the rainbow
Hitting the highway to happiness
"Oh yes, I'm looking to find someone"
Whose meant to be mine
I'm living to love and loving to live
"I've got a heart, I'm longing to give"
I'll follow that star to where you are
Heading for heaven and happiness
I guess somebody somewhere
Someday will teach me to care
But being alone
Don't bother me
I'm free to have fun
It's fun to be free
I'll follow that star
To where you are
Step right up to the love machine
You may get lucky when you zap a dream
"Let the wheel go round, round and round"
You may win that girl you've never found
She may be Suzy or Maybelline
She could be Cathy or Angeline
Try your luck right now on the love machine
We're just a bunch of salty sailors
One thing on our mind
Taking a chance on this machine
Maybe love we'll find
She maybe tall she maybe short
She may be wide
But Lady Luck stop that wheel
On 38-24-35
"Step up, whose next in line"
This love machine don't waste no time
What will your fortune be on the love machine
Let the wheel go round and round and round
And round and round and round and round
Baby you've been lying to me now I'm onto you
It's the same old song but it doesn't ring true
That's right you're wrong again
Time to change and put you on your own again
You've had your way too long
Time for me to be moving on
"You gotta stop, you're wrong again"
Stop  that song again
You've been stepping' out wild and fancy free
Now you've had your fun and you're running back to me
It just can't be if there's no harmony
Then stop!
That's all let's break it up
You've had me fooled now I'm working' up
I see right through your lies
You made me open my eyes
It's too late now I've made up my mind
Being here with you is just a waste of time
Nothing to say so I'll be on my way
Stop!
Then stop! Stop! You're wrong again
Stop that song again
Stop! You're wrong again
You gotta stop that song again
Lord Almighty
I feel my temperature rising
Higher higher
It's burning through to my soul
"Girl, girl, girl, girl"
You're gonna set me on fire
My brain is flaming
I don't know which way to go
Your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love
"Ooh, ooh, ooh"
"Help me, I'm flaming"
I must be a hundred and nine
"Burning, burning, burning"
And nothing can cool me
I just might turn into smoke
But I feel fine
'Cause your kisses lift me higher
And you light my morning sky
It's coming closer
The flames are now licking my body
Won't you help me
I feel like I'm slipping away
It's hard to breathe
And my chest is a-heaving
"Lord, have mercy"
I'm burning a hole where I lay
Like the sweet song of a choir
"(Ah, ah, burning love)"
"I'm just a hunk, a hunk of burning love"
"Just a hunk, a hunk of burning love"
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she moves me
I don't want to leave her now
"You know I believe, and how"
Somewhere in her smile she knows
All I gotta do is think about her
Something in her style it shows me
You're asking me will our love grow
"I don't know, I don't know"
You stick around and it may show
Born in the heat of the desert
My mother died giving me life
Deprived of the love of a father
Blamed for the loss of his wife
You know Lord I've been in a prison
For something that I never done
It's been one hill after another
I've climbed them all one by one
"But this time, Lord you gave me a mountain"
A mountain I may never climb
It isn't just a hill any longer
You gave me a mountain this time
My woman got tired of the heartaches
Tired of the grief and the strife
So tired of working for nothing
Just tired of being my wife
She took my one ray of sunshine
She took my pride and my joy
She took my reason for living
She took my small baby boy
Ooooh
"Are you sincere when you say ""I love you"""
Are you sincere when you say you love me too
"And are you really mine every day, all the time"
I've gotta know which way to go
"Will our love grow, are you sincere"
"Honey, are you sincere when you say you love me too"
I'm a steamroller baby
I'm about to roll all over you
I'm going to inject your soul
"With sweet rock and roll, poor heaven"
I'm a cement mixer
A churning urn of burning funk
I’m a demolition derby
"A hefty hunk, steaming junk"
With some sweet rock and roll
And shoot you full of rhythm and blues
I'm a napalm bomb
Guaranteed to blow your mind
If I can't have your love now baby
There won't be nothing left behind
"Before you go, walk out on me"
"Take a look around, tell me what you see"
Here I stand like an open book
"Is there something here, you might have overlooked"
'Cause it would be a shame if you should leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be
The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad
Now you say that you've grown tired
You want to be by yourself awhile
It would be a shame if you should go
And find that freedom was a long time ago
I know that you can't stand the chains that bind you
They just keep on drivin' us apart
And you could go where I could never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart
"So one more time, for ol' times sake"
Come and lay your head upon my chest
Please don't throw this moment away
We can forget the bad and take the best
If you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake
And if you don't have nothing left to say
Sweet Angeline I loved you much more than poets say in rhyme
Just for one short time
Sweet Angeline remember though we've not seen the summer through
I lived only for you
I'm only human and I realize it's no use trying to disguise
My love for you Angeline has ended
So let's be thankful now not sad
For the little love we've had
If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share
Would always be
There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
And make us realize our night is over
When you walk away from me
There is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun
That rises over the land
I watch you walk away
Somehow I have to let you go
Because it's over
If you knew just how I really feel
You might return and yet
There are so many times
That people have to love and then forget
Oh there might have been a way somehow
I have to force myself to say
It's over
So I turn my back
Turn my collar to the wind
Move along in silence
Trying not to think at all
I set my feet before me
Walk the silent street before me
Now it's over
Hear that lonesome whip-poor-will
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry
Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves began to die
That means he's lost the will to live
The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
"Take good care of her, take good care of her"
I suppose I ought to say congratulations
For you won the only girl I ever loved
But I hurt too much to face the situation
"Just take good care of her, take good care of her"
Just to be around her was my greatest pleasure
She was everything my future held in store
So remember when you take my only treasure
"I must accept it, she loves you more than me"
So with my broken heart I'll bow out gracefully
Please don't send me any wedding invitation
For I couldn't bear to see her there with you
"If she's happy, that will be my consolation"
When Moses walked the children out of Egypt land
"Said now don't you worry, we're in the Lord's hands"
"He's gonna walk beside us, the time is coming' near"
He's gonna wash away all our misery and our fear
I got a feeling' in my body
This will be our lucky day
We'll be releasing all our sorrow
Leave it layin' along the way
When Daniel faced the lion there wasn't any doubt
You got to be like Daniel and the Lord will help us out
Won't you lift your eyes up children
Lift them to the sky
"Heaven stands before you, gates are open wide"
"Shelter for the weary, comfort for the weak"
"We'll leave the devil's evil, sweatin' on the street"
"I gotta, I gotta, I gotta"
I got a feeling in my body
I wanna know
I wanna know right now
"Yeah. yeah, I got a feel"
I got a feeling'
I got a feeling
He left the splendor of heaven
Knowing His destiny
Was the lonely hill of Golgotha
There to lay down His life for me
And if that isn't love
Then the ocean is dry
There's no stars in the sky
And the little sparrows can't fly
Yeah if that isn't love
Then heaven's a myth
There's no feeling like this
If that isn't love
Even in death He remembered
The thief hanging by His side
Then he spoke of love and compassion
And He took him to paradise
It's got to be love
I've got something to tell you
That I think you ought to know
That my eyes are on you baby
Since a long time ago
And now I finally got the nerve
And I'm gonna make my move
Now don't you try to turn me off
Cause it's gonna be hard to do
I've got a thing about you baby
Ain't nothing I can do
A thing about loving you
Ain't it just like a woman
When she knows she's got a man
She'll wring you out and turn you about
In the palm of her hand
And then she starts to thinking
Then maybe she's put you in a blind
She'll give you just a little lovin'
It'll drive you out of your mind
Blue Spanish eyes teardrops are falling from your Spanish eyes
"Please please don't cry, this is just adios and not good-bye"
"Soon I'll return, bringing you all the love your heart can hold"
"Please say ""Si Si"" say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me"
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me
Everybody's gone away
Said they're movin to L.A
There's not a soul I know around
Everybody's leavin' town
"Some caught a freight, some caught a plane"
"Found the sunshine, leave the rain"
They said this town will waste their time
"I guess they're right, it's wasting mine"
"Some gotta win, some gotta lose"
Good time Charlie's got the blues
You know my heart keeps tellin' me
You're not a kid at thirty-three
"Play around, you'll lose your wife"
You play it too long you'll lose your life
When was the last time you kissed me
And I don't mean a touch now and then
It's been a long time since you felt like my woman
Even longer since I felt like your man
So tell me if you think it's over
And I'll leave it up to you how it ends
Because if you don't want the love I can give you
"Well, there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in"
"You never look at me and say, ""I love you"""
How much more do you think I can stand?
"Oh, and there's an old friend out there and she's waiting"
"Lord, she's happy just holding my hand"
"Yes, there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in"
"Here's another dime for you, Mr. Songman"
"Sing the loneliness of broken dreams away, if you can"
"Yes it's only me and you, Mr. Songman"
"Take away the night sing away my hurt, Mr. Songman"
"In your ivory covered house, safe behind your walls of glass"
You keep staring back at me like a memory from the past
Won't you sing me away to a summer night
Let me hold you in my arms again
I know memory's not re-living
But at least it's not the end
Here's another dime for you Mr. Songman
"Won't you take away the night, sing away my hurt, Mr. Songman"
Let me hold her in my arms again
Maybe it's too late
Sometimes even hate myself
For loving you
Trying to be strong
Then night time comes along
"And I start loving you, wanting you"
Where is all my self control?
I'm burning way down in my soul
And needing you
Wishing I could be the man I try to
Hating me for wanting to be with you
Knowing you don't love me like you used to
"But it's midnight, oh, and I miss you"
It's getting late and I know
That's when I am weak
Funny how things have a way
Of looking so much brighter in the daylight
I hope to go to bed
And try to straighten out my head
And just forget you
"Oh, but it's midnight and I miss you"
It's midnight and I miss you
"I woke up this morning and I tried to call you, mmm"
"But you weren't there, kinda put me in despair"
So I thought that maybe I could lose my mind
In the countryside so I went for a ride
But I never stopped thinking about you
Found myself wishing you were there
"Just to be with me, feel the breeze"
Sun didn't smile I didn't care
I decided to try just one more time
To let you know I really love you so
Before I arrived I saw you go away
"With another guy, a tear filled my eye"
A long time has passed since that day I cried
Life is fine and I'm doing fine
When I'm at home and I feel all alone
"Well I think of you, try to get a message through"
Long ago and far away
In my old common labor shoes
I turned the world all which-a-way
Just because you asked me to
Likened to no other feel
Simple love is simple truth
There's no end to what I'd do
Let the world call me a fool
Let it; things are right with me and you
That's all that matters and I'll do
Anything you ask me to
Knowing how much I love you
After all I've been through
I'd turn and walk away from you
The people ask me how
How I've lived till now
I tell them I don't know
I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand
And yes I know how lonely life can be
Shadows follow me
The night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me
And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do
The book of life is brief
Once the page is read
All but love is dead
This is my believe
Just leave it to me
Don't ever be ashamed
Just give me a chance
I'll take care of everything
Your troubles I'll share
Let me know and I'll be there
I'll take care of you
Anyplace and anywhere
"Shake a hand, shake a hand"
Shake a hand if you can
Be truthful to me
I'll be truthful to you
I'm in love with you so
Till I don't know what to do
"So, let's call it a day"
I've said all I have to say
Except don't forget to pray
And shake a hand every day
A water glass full of whiskey
And women that I never knew too well
"Lord, the things I've seen and done"
Most of which I'd be ashamed to tell
I don't know how it started
"But that's what makes a man a man, I guess"
Now I'm holding on to nothing
Trying' to forget the rest
I'm looking back on my life
To see if I can find the pieces
I know that some were stolen
And some just blew away
"Well, I found the bad parts"
Found all the sad parts
But I guess I threw the best part away
"Lord away, away"
"Playin' the bars, playin' like a star"
Anything to get a name
"Carryin' on, livin' on songs"
My friends wrote for me to sing
But I guess I threw the best parts away
"Away, away"
"Lord, the pieces of my life"
"They're everywhere, they're everywhere"
And the one I think I miss most of all
Is you and you know who
Looking back on my life Lord
Looking back on my life today
Looking back on my life
God help me find the pieces
The old hometown looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa
Down the road I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
"It's good to touch the green, green grass of home"
"Yes, they'll all come to meet me"
All creatures smiling sweetly
The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane I'll walk with my sweet Mary
"Arms reaching, smiling sweetly"
Then I awake and look around me
Four gray walls surround me
And I realize I was only dreaming
There's a guard and there's a sad old padre
Arm and arm we'll walk at daybreak
"Again I'll touch the green, green grass of home"
In the shade of that old oak tree
"As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home"
I'm so hurt to think that you lied to me
I'm hurt way down deep inside of me
"You said our love was true and we'll never, never part"
Now you've got someone new and it breaks my heart
"I'm hurt, much more than you'll ever know"
"Yes darling, I'm so hurt because I still love you so"
But even though you hurt me like nobody else could ever do
"I would never ever hurt you, oh you, not you"
"Had a dream about you baby, had a dream about me and you"
Had a dream and woke up crying
Well I can roll but I just can't rock
"And the time's going by, tick-tock"
"For the heart, I just can't love no-one but you"
"Well I'm high and dry and lonely, I'm as lonely as can be"
And I stare out of my window
Well I can play but I just can't win
And the weather's looking dim
For the heart I just can't love no-one but you
For the heart
"Well, for the heart"
"Yes, for the heart"
I told her to leave me alone
That's what she's done
Just what she's done
"And a house built for two, ain't a home"
"When it's lived in by one, one lonely one"
And I can no longer hear footsteps
Come right down the hall
Here come the teardrops
"Bitter they are, harder they fall"
She caught me lying
Then she caught a train
And I caught a fever
"Walking home in the rain, oh yeah"
But it's over and I'm done
She left me once and for all
"There was a man, a lonely man"
Who lost his love through his indifference
A heart that cared that went unshared
Until it died within his silence
And Solitaire is the only game in town
"And every road that takes him, takes him down"
While life goes on around him everywhere
He's playing Solitaire
And keeping to himself begins to deal
And still the King of Hearts is well concealed
Another losing game comes to an end
And deals them out again
A little hope goes up in smoke
"Just how it goes, goes without saying"
Who would command the hand he's playing
Life goes on around him everywhere
I remember how your eyes used to light up
Over promises that I made
But for the first time in my life
I know now how it feels to be afraid
I don't know what I'd do if you go away
This would sure be one lonely old town
For a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love coming down
Love coming down
I remember all the times you told me
Love's all that matters to you
"And looking back now, wondering how I believed"
I had things more important to do
I can see how I must have looked to you
Like some fool on a merry-go-round
And that a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love going down
Love going down
Can't you see how everything I've learned
Would just be wasted if you leave me
If you just give one more try
I swear I'll always be here when you need me
If you can find it in your heart to forgive me
I'll try to keep both my feet on the ground
But if a man's so busy going up in the world
I've been in love so many times
I thought I knew the score
Now you've treated me so wrong
I can't take any more
And it looks like I'm never gonna fall in love again
"Fall in love, I'm never gonna fall in love"
"I mean it, I mean it, fall in love again"
"I gave my heart so easily, cast aside my pride"
When I saw you in his arms baby
I broke up and cried
"That's what I'm saying Fall in love, No, I'm never gonna fall in love"
Please don't make me fall in love again
"That's why I, no, I'm never gonna fall in love"
"Please don't make me, don't make me, fall in love again"
"Babe, you're getting closer"
The lights are going dim
The sound of your breathing
Has made the mood I'm in
All of my resistance
Is lying on the floor
Taking me to places
I've never been before
"Ooh, and I can feel it"
"Feel it, feel it, feel it"
Way down where the music plays
Way down like a tidal wave
Way down where the fires blaze
"Way down, down, way, way on down"
"Ooh, my head is spinning"
You got me in your spell
A hundred magic fingers
On a whirling carousel
The medicine within me
No doctor could prescribe
Your love is doing something
That I just can't describe
Hold me again
Tight as you can
I need you so
"Baby, let's go"
Forever my darling
Our love will be true
Always and forever
I'll love only you
Just promise me darling
Your love in return
May this fire in my soul dear
Forever burn
My heart's at your command dear
"To keep, love and to hold"
Making you happy's my desire
Keeping you is my goal
I'll forever love you
For the rest of my days
I'll never part from you
For your loving ways
Making you happy's my desire dear
Loving you is my goal
"Well, it's hard to be a gambler"
Betting' on the number
That changes every time
"Well, you think you're gonna win"
Think she's givin' in
A stranger's all you find
"Yeah, it's hard to figure out"
What she's all about
That she's a woman through and through
"She's a complicated lady, so color my baby moody blue"
"Oh, Moody blue"
Tell me am I gettin' through
I keep hanging' on
Try to learn your song
But I never do
Tell me who I'm talking' to
You're like night and day
And it's hard to say
Which one is you
"Well, when Monday comes she's Tuesday"
When Tuesday comes she's Wednesday
Into another day again
Her personality unwinds
Just like a ball of twine
On a spool that never ends
Just when I think I know her well
Her emotions reveal
She's not the person that
I thought I knew
Oh just because I asked a friend about her
Just because I spoke her name somewhere
Just because I rang her number by mistake today
"You know she thinks I, I still care"
And just because I haunt the same old places
With a memory I will linger everywhere
Just because I'm not the happy guy I used to be
"Lord, you know, she thinks I still care"
"Well, if she's happy thinking I still need her"
"Yeah, let that silly notion bring her cheer"
Oh how could she ever be so foolish
"Tell me where did she get, lord such an idea"
"Yeah, oh lord"
Just because I asked a friend about her
"And you know, just because I spoke her name somewhere"
"Just because, lord I saw her and went to pieces"
"Lord, you know, she thinks I, lord, still care"
"You know, she thinks I, I still care"
"Lord, she thinks I still care"
Oh no she thinks I still care
Why me Lord? What have I ever done
To deserve even one of the pleasures I've known
Tell me Lord what did I ever do to deserve loving You?
"And the kindness, You've shown"
"Lord Heavenly Jesus, I'm wasted and"
"So help me Jesus, I know what I am"
Now that I know that I needed You so
"Help me Jesus, my soul's in Your hands"
"Try me Lord, if you think there's a way"
"I can ever repay, all I've taken from You"
"Maybe Lord, I can show someone else"
What I've been through myself
On my way back to You
"Lord Heavenly Jesus, I praise Him"
"So help me Jesus, I know what I am, oh yes"
"Jesus, my soul's in Your hands"
Bright light city going to set my soul
Going to set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up higher
There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
And they're all living the devil may care
And I'm just the devil with love to spare
"Viva Las Vegas, Viva Las Vegas"
How I wish that there were more
Than the twenty-four hours in the day
Even if there were forty more
I wouldn't sleep a minute away
"Oh, there's black jack and poker and the roulette wheel"
A fortune won and lost on every deal
All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel
Viva Las Vegas with you neon flashing
And your one arm bandits crashing
All those hopes down the drain
Viva Las Vegas turning day into nighttime
Turning night into daytime
If you see it once
You'll never be the same again
I'm going to keep on the run
I'm going to have me some fun
If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke oh well
I'll always remember that I had a swinging time
I'm gonna give it everything I've got
Lady luck please let the dice stay hot
Let me shoot a seven with every shot
Viva Las Vegas
"Viva, Viva Las Vegas"
"Fool, fool, fool"
That I was to fall for you
"Well, fool, fool, fool"
"Well, I know what a fool I was"
"To think that you could love me, too"
"Well, well, when I first met you, baby"
"Well, I knew I couldn't win"
But I just kept right on trying
'Cause trying is no sin
"What a fool, fool, fool"
"Well, when I first met you, baby"
What a fool that I was to fall for you
To think that you could love me too
Today I stumbled from my bed
With thunder crashing in my head
My pillow still wet
From last night tears
And as I think of giving up
A voice inside my coffee-cup
"Kept crying out, ringing in my ears"
Don't cry daddy
"Daddy, please don't cry"
"Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy"
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
"Daddy, daddy, please laugh again"
Daddy ride us on your back again
"Oh, daddy, please don't cry"
Why are children always first
To feel the pain and hurt the worst
"It's true, but somehow"
It just don't seem right
Cause every time I cry I know
It hurts my little children so
I wonder will it be the same tonight
Whenever I dance with the girl I love
My head goes 'round and 'round
When she's close to me
I can't stay on the ground
I never have a care
All night I'm so light
I walk right on the air
"Oh let me, oh honey let me"
Let me do what you know I love to do
Please take another chance and let me
Let me have another dance with you
Whenever I feel those pretty arms
Reaching 'round about
That feeling goes to my toes
"And all the lights go out, go out, go out"
Whenever I see those eyes of blue
Smiling up so shy
I'm in such a spin
I take right off and fly
"So let me, oh honey let me"
So let me dance in the arms I love
Thrill me through and through
I'm so drunk with love
And all I see is you
I never hear the music play
I never see the crowd
Only you and me
"Dancing on a cloud, a cloud, a cloud"
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
(You were always on my mind)
Maybe I didn't hold you
"All those lonely, lonely times"
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
If I make you feel second best
"Girl, I'm so sorry I was blind"
Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
Give me
"Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied, satisfied"
And I guess I never told you...
"Build it up, knock it down"
"Hold it square, roll it around"
Throw it in the air
Stick it in the ground
"But it's too bad, I can't get mad"
'Cause I'm a roustabout
"Tie it loose, make it tight"
"If it's wrong, do it right"
Makes me kinda feel
Like I wanna fight
Orders all day and half the night from the boss T
That guy just doesn't wanna see one minute lost
"Stack it up, in the rear"
Better still bring it here
"Wanna take it out, stick it in his ear"
A handyman is all I am around this place
"Every time I turn around, he's right up in my face"
"Bring it in, bring it out"
"When I'm slow, boy he shouts"
"Getting awful tired, running in and out"
"Stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy"
If your rubbernecking baby well that's all right with me
It's called rubbernecking baby but that's all right with me
"Some people say I'm wasting time yeah, but they don't really know"
"I like what I see I see what I like yeah, it gives me such a glow"
"First thing in the morning, last thing at night"
"I look, stare everywhere and see everything inside"
Sitting on the back porch all by myself
Along came Mary Jane with somebody else
"Well, stop, look and listen baby that's my philosophy"
"Some people say I'm wasting time yeh, but I don't really care"
"I like what I see, I see what I like yeh, it gives me such a glow"
Stop
"Oh well, I'm tired and so weary"
But I must go alone
"Till the lord comes and calls, calls me away, oh yes"
Well the morning's so bright
And the lamp is alight
"And the night, night is as black as the sea, oh yes"
"There will be peace in the valley for me, some day"
"There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray"
"There'll be no sadness, no sorrow"
"No trouble, trouble I see"
"There will be peace in the valley for me, for me"
Well the bear will be gentle
And the wolves will be tame
"And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes"
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be lit by a child
"And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes"
A rose grows wild in the country
A tree grows tall as the sky
The wind blows wild in the country
"And part of the wild, wild country, am I"
"Wild, wild, like the deer and the dove"
Wild and free is this land that I love
A dream grows wild in the country
A love grows tall as the sky
A heart beats wild in the country
And here with a dream in my heart
"Part of the wild, wild country, am I"
When you walk through a storm hold your head up high
And don't be afraid of the dark
At the end of a storm is a golden sky
And the sweet silver song of a lark
Walk on through the wind
Walk on through the rain
Tho' your dreams be tossed and blown
"Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart"
And you'll never walk alone
"You'll never, ever walk alone"
"She loves me, she loves me not"
"She loves me, she loves me, she loves me"
The lady loves me and it shows
In spite of the way she turns up her nose
"I'm her ideal, her hearts desire"
Under that ice she's burning like fire
She'd like to cuddle up to me
She's playing hard to get
"The lady loves me, but she doesn't know it yet"
The gentleman has savoir-faire
As much as an elephant or a bear
I'd like to take him for a spin
Back to the zoo to visit his kin
He's got about as much appeal as a soggy cigarette
The lady loathes him but he doesn't know it yet
The lady's got a crush on me
The gentleman's crazy obviously
The lady's dying to be kissed
The gentleman needs a psychiatrist
I'd rather kiss a rattlesnake
Or play Russian roulette
She's falling fast she's on the skids
Both of his heads are flipping their lids
Tonight she'll hold me in her arms
I'd rather be holding hydrogen bombs
Will someone tell this Romeo
I'm not his Juliet
She wants me
Like poison ivy
Needs me
Like a hole in the head
Everyone can see she's got it bad
He's mad!
The gentleman is an egotist
I'm simply aware I'm hard to resist
He's one man I could learn to hate
How's about having dinner at eight
I'd rather dine with Frankenstein
In a moonlight tete-a-tete
Oh yes she loves me
Dig that shrinking violet
Oh she really loves me
Here's one gal you'll never get
She lo- lo- loves me
Would you like to make a bet
I said the lady loves me
The gentleman's all wet

"Put on your red dress baby 'cause we're going out tonight, oh yeah!"
"Put on your red dress baby 'cause we're going out tonight, yeah!"
Well now wear some boxing gloves in case some fool might start a fight
You know what i'm sayin'
"Put on your hi-heel sneakers, put your wig hat on your head, oh yeah!"
"Put on your hi-heel sneakers, slap that wig right on your head, yeah!"
"Well i'm pretty sure now baby, pretty soon you're gonna knock 'em dead"
Oh gonna mess around baby
All right!
Da da da da etc
Walk around baby!
Da da da etc
All right take it home baby!
"Oh, mama liked the roses she grew them in the yard"
But Winter always came around and made the growing way too hard
"Oh, mama liked the roses and when she had the time"
"She'd decorate the living room, for all us kids to see"
When I hear the Sunday bells ringing in the morning
I remember crying when she used to sing
"Oh, mama liked the roses but most of all she cared"
About the way we learned to live
And if we said our prayers
You know I kept the family bible
With a rose that she saved inside
It was pressed between the pages
Like it had found a place to hide
"Oh, mama liked the roses in such a special way"
We bring them every Mother's Day
And put them on her grave
"Oh, mama liked the roses Mmmm"
Mama liked the roses
"... mm, stepping through the sinking sand"
To the cross of Calvary
"Mm, let it be my prayer, dear Lord, each day"
To help me do the best I can
For there is no friend on whom I can depend
"Blessed Jesus, hold my hand"
"Blessed Jesus, hold my hand ..."
"Oh, yes, I need Thee every hour"
Through the this pilgrims land
Protect me by thy saving power
"Please, hear my feeble plea"
"Oh, hoh, Lord, please, tell me"
"I kneel in prayer, I try to meet you there"
"Blessed Jesus, hold my hand, hold my hand"
"If you're in Arizona, I'll follow you"
"If you're in Albuquerque, I'll be there too"
We'll have a little chance to start a-new
Because my love is endless for you
My heart cries for you
"Sighs for you, dies for you"
My arms long for you
Please come back to me
An unimportant quarrel
Is what we had
We have to learn to live with the good and bad
Come together da da da la dum....
This loneliness is driving me mad
"Please come back, come back, come back to me"
All en el rancho grande
All donde vva
Habl una rancherita
Que alegre me deca
Que alegre me deca:
"""Te voy hacer unas calzones"
Comos los que esa el ranchero
Los comenzo de lana
"Y los acabo de hierro."""
There in the great ranch
There where she used to live
There used to be a cowgirl
Who joyfully used to tell me
"""I'm going to make some trousers"
Like those which the cowboy wears
I'm starting them with wool
"And I'm finishing them with iron."""
"One night of sin, yeah"
Is what I'm now paying for
The things I did and I saw
Would make the earth stand still
Don't call my name
It makes me feel so ashamed
I lost my sweet helping hand
I got myself to blame
Ain't never did no wrong
Now I know that very quiet life
Has caused me nothing but harm
One night of sin
But now I know that very quiet life
Softly (Softly)
I will leave you (I will leave you softly)
For my heart would break (For my heart would break)
If you should wake (If you should wake)
And see me go (And see me go)
So I leave you (So I leave you)
Long before you miss me (Long before you miss me)
Long before your arms can beg me stay (Long before your arms can beg me stay)
For one more hour (For one more hour)
For one more day (For one more day)
After all the years (After all the years)
I can't bare the tears (I can't bare the tears)
To fall (To fall)
"So softly, (So softly) so softly"
(I will leave you there)
I will leave you
I will leave you there
"Little sister, don't you, little sister, don't you"
Then say it's very nice and then you run
"Little sister, don't you do what your big sister done"
"Well, I dated your big sister, then took her to a show"
"I went for some candy, along came Jim Dandy"
"Hey, get back, hey, get back"
"Hey, get back to where you once belonged"
"Hey, get back to where you once belonged, yeah"
"Hey, get back, back"
"Get back to where you once belonged, yeah"
"(You) Where, o where are you"
Tell me where are you
Where are the nights we spent together
Where is your promise
That you will leave me never
I've been blue the whole day through
Where o where are you
Keep your hands off of her
She don't belong to you
"She's mine, o mine, no matter what I do"
"She's long, lean and lanky"
Tadadadaadaaa
"Hands off of her, she don't belong to you"
Ten thousand miles even though I roam
I can hear the call of the hills of home
The canyons high and the valleys low
Echo how can you stay away
My dreams are there where the eagle flies
Where the mountain tops seem to touch the sky
The winding streams and the winds that blow
Ask me how can you stay away
Far too long have I stayed apart
From this land that I love and divide my heart
"Now, now I know I must go"
Where the hills say don't stay away
The first time ever I saw your face
I thought the sun rose in your eyes
And the moon and stars were the gifts you gave
To the dark and the empty skies my love
To the dark and the empty skies
The first time ever I kissed your mouth
I felt the earth move in my hands
Like a trembling heart of a captive bird
That was there at my command my love
That was there at my command
Hoa hoa hoa oh oh oh oh oh oh
Woh oh oh oh hoa hoa hoa
Oh hoa hoa hoa hoa hoa hoa
As you travel alone on the jericho road
ELVIS I would take Young JOHNNY CASH to do this
Does the road seem all long and heavy your load
Just take it to CHRIST your sins all confess
On the Jericho Road your heart He will bless
On the Jericho Road
"Dominic, Dominic why are you stallin'"
Don't you hear love callin' to you
"Moo, moo, move your little foot do"
"Dominic, Dominic pick one of them ticker"
There's acres and acres to choose
"Oh, oh, only a fool would refuse"
"I, I, If I had your trouble"
Life would be double good sweet
There'd be no grass growin' under my feet
"Listen Dominic, Dominic when will you hunger"
You ain't gettin' younger my friend
"Love, love, love 'em all right to the end"
"I, I, I can't understand you, leavin' them beauties forlorn"
It's time to take the old bull by the horn
"Come on Dominic, Dominic, they're itchin' and twitchin'"
Better start pickin' some woo
"Moo, moo, move your little foot do!"
Our little girl had taken sick one evening
As she walked home from shcool
And then her deathbed soon claimed her
It made us so sad and so blue
Then she called me close to her bedside
And whispered these words soft and low
Tell mommy to come to me quickly
I want to kiss you both and go
I hear a sweet voice calling
Way up in Heaven on high
God has made room for your daughter
Oh mommy and daddy dont cry
Take care of little brother
Tell him I'm gone to rest
I know his little heart is broken
He's all that you have left
Then she closed eyes forever
Never to see us no more
Until we meet our darlin
On that bright and peaceful shore
"If I can never see you, if I can never hold you"
If I can never touch your face or feel your warm embrace
"I still remember talkin', I still remember laughin'"
I still remember lovin' you a lot and touchin' you
"Only bringin' it back, only just bringin' it back"
"A familiar face, a familiar face just brings it all back"
"Everything's bringin' it back, good songs bringin' it back"
"Even after so much time, everything's bringin' it back"
"Thinkin' in my solitude, wonderin' about your attitude"
Thinkin' maybe that your love has died
"There it is, I can see it in your eyes"
"A look of sweet surrender, a touch of too much sadness"
"'Cause I've hurt you so, you know your sorrow shows"
"You just can't stay, but you can't let go"
When the snow is on the roses
When the bluebird's flown away
In my arms I will remember
All the love we shared today
In my arms we will remember
They call me the tiger man
They call me tiger man
And I call my black cat back
My black cat comes a runnin'
And the hound dogs get way back
And the hound dogs stay way back
Beware of a gal in britches
Yo-di-o-di-o
Never trust no gal in britches
No-di-o-di-o
If you had a sense of this here horse
You woulda knowed it by now of course
Who wears the britches is the boss
"That's a gal, that's a gal in britches"
Don't mess with a gal in britches
No feminine gal wears britches
She'll beg you to come to the country dance
You ride twenty miles for the big romance
She shows up in her brother's pants
What'd you expect from a gal in britches
Yo-di-o-di-o-i-ay
It's none of my misfortune
Yo-di-o-di-o-di-ay
Just thought you'd like to know
Don't marry no gal in britches
You'll never know which is which's
She'll put a halter through your nose
Have you cooking and washing clothes
While she goes chasing them buffaloes
"Bet your boots, that's a gal in britches"
"Oh, how I love Jesus"
Because He first loved me
When I am discouraged
And I feel the gloom
God sends His angel
To see Him my broom
IU hear the singing
I'm satisfied
"I know, I know"
That Jesus is mine
"Oh, how I love Jesus (He is so wonderful)"
To know that Jesus is mine
"Girls in kimonos, shy little flowers"
Smiling from beneath their parasols
"Dainty little moonbeams, delicate as china"
Gentle little oriental dolls
Hearts made of stone will never break
"'Cause your love is never there, they just don't care"
"You can ask and plea, please, please, please work"
And all your love is there to stay
These hearts of stone will cause you pain
Although you love there has stopped just the same
"But they'll say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no"
"You daddy know, I thought I knew hearts made of stone"
"Cause they'll say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no"
Well a hundred years from now I won't be crying
A hundred years from now I won't be blue
My heart will have to forget that we ever met
But I won't care a hundred years from now
I'll never forget sweetheart the night you told me
That you couldn't live without my love somehow
That's all in the past I knew it wouldn't last
"Our Father, Who Art in Heaven"
"Hallowed be, Thy Name"
"Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be Done"
"On earth, as it is, in Heaven"
"Give us this day, our daily bread"
"And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors"
"And lead us not into temptation,but deliver us from evil"
"For Thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory forever"
Amen
"Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, man have named you"
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile
Is it only 'cause you're lonely man have blamed you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile
Do you smile to tempt a lover Mona Lisa
Or is it your way to hide a broken heart
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
They just lie there and they die there
"Are you warm, are you real Mona Lisa"
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art
La la la la......
"Underneath the foliage, in its bower set"
Loveliest of the flowers of spring
Blooms the violet
"(Violet, violet, flower of N.Y.U.)"
We will ever sing thy praise
To thee we'll ere be true
(We'll be true)
I'm beginning to forget you
That old heartache is gone
I'm beginning to sleep at night
No more crying 'till dawn
I can hear your name mentioned
And it brings no misery
I'm beginnin to forget you
Like you forgot me
I'm beginning to smile again
After crying for so long
I can hear the tune we loved so well
And it's just another song
I'm so happy that it's over
I'm so thankful to be free
"Dark moon, way up high up in the sky"
"Oh, tell me why, oh tell me why"
You've lost your splendor
"Dark moon, what is the cause your life withdraws"
"Is it because, is it because I've lost my love"
Mortals have dreams of love's perfect schemes
"But they don't realize, their love can sometimes bring the"
What is the cause your light withdraws
I love you because you understand dear
Every single thing I try to do
"You're always there to lend a helping hand, dear"
I love you most of all because you're you
No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you
"I love you because, because my heart is ligther"
"Honey everytime, everytime I'm walking by your side"
"And I love you, yes I love you because the future is a little bit brighter"
"And the door, the door of my happiness, you open wide"
No matter what may be the style or season
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
If you found someone new who means more than me to you
I'd never stand in your way
"If you feel we must part, don't let pity rule your heart"
I'll never stand in your way
I love you much too much to ever lose you
But what is to be will be and I'll obey
I'll be blue when you go but I'll never let it show
I loved you much too much to ever lose you
I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in
Well then a little light from heaven healed my soul
"Well, he bathed my heart in love, and wrote my name above"
Well just a little talk with my Jesus gonna it right
We'll just have a little talk with Jesus
We're gonna tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our fainted cry
He will answer by and by
"Oh well, when you feel a little prayer wheel turning"
And you will know a little fire is burnin'
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right
You may have doubts and fears
Your eye be filled with tears
Oh well my Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
"Well he wrote my name above, and he bathed my heart in love"
Oh well just a little talk with my Jesus gonna make it right
Let us have a little talk with my Jesus
Please let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry
Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning
You'll know just a little fire is burnin'
And have a little talk with my Jesus gonna makes it right
Well you may have doubts and fears
Oh well now my Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
Well you go to Him in prayer

I was dancin' with my darlin' to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced her to my loved one
And while they were dancin'
My friend stole my sweetheart from me
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
"Yes, I lost my little darlin' the night they were playing"
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz
I'll hold you tight in the moonlight tonight
I love you Mary Lou Brown
Twinkeling stars told the milky white way
That I marry Mary Lou Brown
And I will tell all the world
Of my young Southern girl
See her tonight beyond moonlight
So I can hold Mary tight
I'll bring my guitar to the moonlight tonight
Imagine your heart floating right up the sigh (?)
Down by the green river side with my arms open wide
"I'll wait for her, only for her"
Mary Lou Brown's mine tonight
"Oh, Rock of ages, hide Thou me"
There is no other refuge
Can save but thee
Through this old world
"I've wandered so far, far from thee"
Then I cry
"Ooh, rock of ages"
Hide thou me
We call on him
Whenever storm clouds gather
We call on him to light our darkest day
Why must it be that only when we're lonely
"And hopes are dim, we call on him"
Why don't we call on him before we lose our way
To count our blessings and thank him while we may
When no one else will answer
We ask of him a reason to go on
When our cup of joy becomes a cup of sorrow
"Filled to the brim, we call on him"
O beautiful for spacious skies
For amber waves of grain
For purple mountain majesties
Above thy fruited plain
"America, America"
God shed His grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea
For beautiful..for spacious skies
For purple mountain..majesties
Above the fruited plain...
America!...America!...
God shed His grace..on thee..
"And crowned thy good, with brotherhood"
From sea...to shining sea...
America!..America!!
God shed his grace on thee
From sea...to..shining..sea!!
AMERICA!!!....
... remember alone in my heart
Call back my love of San Antonio
Just pretend like tales fall apart
"Think once again of my love, my own"
A few words not known .... my heart I belong...
I don't know... of my rose in San Antonio
Growing all this tender lala heart
Call back my love in San Antonio
It's so sweet and tender like peddles fall apart...
Rose in San Antonio... know my rose in San Antonio
Softly and tenderly jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
Patient and loving he's waiting and watching;
Watching for you and for me
"Come home, come home"
Ye who are weary come home;
"Earnestly, tenderly, jesus is calling;"
"Calling, ""o sinner, come home!"""
Why should we linger when jesus is pleading
Pleading for you and for me?
"Why should we wait, then, and heed not his mercies;"
Mercies for you and for me?
O for the wonderful love he has promised
Promised for you and for me
Though we have sinned he has mercy and pardon;
Pardon for you and for me
"I could wander the byway, rewander too"
But it wouldn't be the same without you
Those familiar old places would just make me blue
'Cause it wouldn't be the same without you
I wasted my love on a careless romance
"But I'd do it again, if I had the chance"
I could start my life over with somebody new
Well get out of that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Get out of that kitchen and rattle those pots and pans
Well I want my breakfast 'cause I'm a hungry man
I believe you're doin' me wrong and now I know
'cause the harder I work the faster my money goes
Well you won't do right
To save your doggone soul
I'm like the one-eyed cat peeping in a seafood store
Well I can look at you till you ain't no child no more
I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin' on a hollow stump
I've got so many women I don't know which way to jump
I said flip flop and fly I don't care if I die
I won't ever leave ...
Don't ever say goodbye
You ask how much I need you
Must I explain
I need you oh my darling
Like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I'll tell you true
Until the twelfth of never I'll still be loving you
Hold me close
Never let me go
Melt my heart like April snow
I'll love you 'till the blue bells forget to bloom
I'll love you 'till the clover has lost its perfume
I'll love you 'till the poets run out of rhyme
"Oh, until the twelfth of never"
And that's a long long time
Until the twelfth of never
"I awakened this morning, I was filled with despair"
"All my dreams turned to ashes and gone, oh yeah"
As I looked at my life it was barren and bare
Without love I've had nothing at all
Without love I've had nothing
I have conquered the world
All but one thing did I have
Once I had a sweetheart who loved only me
"There was nothing, oh that she would not give, oh no"
But I was blind to her goodness and I could not see
That a heart without love cannot live
"What he's done for others, he'll do for you"
"With arms wide open, he'll pardon you"
There is no night for in his light
You never walk alone
Take him at his promise
"Tony is a Capricorn, a leader of men"
And he has a kinda stubborn streak
But when it comes to the opposite sex
Tony's kinda shy and weak
"Oh, but he can be hot stuff"
See the look on his face
If you want a wedding
It's him you've gotta chase
"Uh, uh, uh"
"Signs of the zodiac, signs of the zodiac"
The future is in those little signs of the zodiac
Michael is a Scorpio; he can't make up his mind
Poor boy he can't decide at all
He wants one girl and then another
Soon there'll be none left but mother
"Oh, but, Michael, that won't do"
That just won't do at all
You can't marry your mother
"Your mother's much too tall, ha ha, ho ho"
"Billy is a Libra, a sign of love"
Billy has a one-track mind
He's great in the kitchen and never complains
He's the happily married kind
Help is there in your future if you just look around
You don't know your astrology from a hole in the ground
Gentleman songsters off on a spree
Doomed from here to eternity
Lord have mercy on such as we
Baa Baa Baa
(Well now you'd better run)
"Run when I say, somebody's calling you"
You'd better run
"Run when I say, (somebody's calling you)"
I feel like my time has long gone
"Long gone, (my time is long gone)"
Well now goodbye false pretender
Lord I cannot wait for you
For the bible declares you're goin' to heaven Lord
What the bible declares you do
Long gone
Well I met a false pretender
Whose head was bending Lord
I met him in the evening
He was headed down that long lonesome road
"Get away from here, somebody's calling you"
"Long gone, (my time is long gone), long gone"
And even longer since I felt like your man
'Cause if you don't want the love I can give you
Well there's a honky tonk angel who will take me back in
"You never look at me and say ""I love you"""
How much more do you think I can stand
"Oh, there's an old friend out there and she's waiting"
Lord she's happy just holding my hand
"Yes, there's a honky tonk angel who will take me back in"
It's been so long darling since I gazed into your eyes
It's been so long darling but now I realize
And just 'cos by seeing you it hurts me through and through
It's been so long darling that I'm back to you
Jingle bell
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air
"What a bright time, it's the right time"
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
"Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet"
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
An old cowboy went ridin' out
On a dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as
He went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd
Of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowing through the ragged skies
And up the cloudy draw
Their brands were still on fire and
Their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shining and
Their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as
They thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard
And he heard their mournful cry:
"Yippee-yi-yo, yippee-yi-ya"
Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat
They're riding hard to catch that herd
But they ain't caught 'em yet
'cause they've got to ride forever on
That range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on hear their cry:
As the riders loped on by him
He heard one call his name
If you want to save your soul from hell
Ridin' on our range
Then cowboy change your ways today
Or with us you will ride
Trying to catch the devil's herd
Across these endless skies
Baby let me be your lovin teddy bear
Oh let me be your teddy bear
I don't wanna be a tiger
Cause tigers play to rough
Cause lions ain't the kind
You love enough
I just wanna be your teddy bear
Baby let me be around you every night
Run your fingers though my hair
And cuddle me really tight
When I was a little baby
My mother would rock me in the cradle
"In them old, old cotton fields at home"
"Oh, when them cotton balls get rotten"
You couldn't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields at home
It was down in Louisiana
Just a mile from Texarkana
It may sound a little funny
"But, you didn't make very much money"
I was over in Arkansas
"People ask me, ""What you come here for?"""
"Oh, when those cotton balls get rotten"
You can't pick very much cotton
Hold me tight the moon's so bright
Tonight the night is right for love
As one by one the stars appear
"I hold you oh so close, my dear"
This could be that magic kiss
That night of bliss we've waited for
Oh we could fly right up to the sky
How real it all seems to me
That midsummer night dream to me
Can't you see that tonight's all right for love
Ev'rybody's got the fever
Thou giv-est fever when we kisseth
Fever I'm afire
Fever yea I burn forsooth
And the grass won’t pay no mind
The moment we’re living is now
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
"Darling, so it goes"
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you
"Take my whole life, too"
I'm about to roll over you
I'm a napalm-bomb
"Play it Jerry, play it ..."
I got my mojo workin' I got my mojo workin'
Hands off of her unless you want deal with me
"Get your hands off of her, she don't belong to you"
"Yeah, I got my mojo workin' I got my mojo workin'"
There's a guy who said one time -
He said -
You never stood  in that man's shoes
Or saw things through his eyes
Or stood and watched with helpless hands
While the heart inside you dies
So help your brother along the way
No matter where he starts
For the same God that made you made him too
These men with broken hearts

"Froggy went a-courtin’ and he did ride, A-hu"
Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride
"He had a nick-nack-nack by his side, A-hu, A-hu, A-hu"
"He had old Jerry by his side, A-hu, A-hu, Oh yeah"
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I don't have the laugh
I used to weep
There's a shadow hanging over me
"Oh, yesterday, came suddenly"
Why'd she have to go
"I don't know, she wouldn't say"
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
"Oh, I believe in yesterday"
"Hey Jude, don't make it bad"
Take a sad song and make it better
The minute you let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
"Hey Jude, don't let me down"
Let it out and let in
Hey Jude begin
To making the world a little better
Don't you know that it's a fool
Who plays it cool
In making the world a little better
To taking the world upon your shoulder
Na na na na na...
"It wasn't me who changed, but you"
And now you've gone away
But don't you know that now you're gone
"Well, since my baby left me"
"Well, I found a new place to dwell"
"Well, it's down at the end of lonely street"
At Heartbreak Hotel
You make me so lonely baby
"Well, I'm so lonely"
I get so lonely I could die
Although it's always crowded
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry away their gloom
And be so
You make me so lonely baby
Now the bellhop's tears keep flowing
The desk clerk's dressed in black
Well they've been so long on lonely street
They'll never look back
"Well now, if your baby leaves you"
And you got a tale to tell
Just take a walk down lonely street
To Heartbreak Hotel
Baby let me be
Your lovin teddy bear
Oh let me be
Your teddy bear
Cause tigers play too rough
"Just wanna be, your teddy bear"
Oh let me be
"Baby let me be, around you every night"
Baby it's just you I'm thinking of
Come on over here and love me
"I really love you baby, cross my heart"
And let us say I do
Love me tender
Love me sweet
You have made my life complete
And I love you so
Love me true
All my dreams fulfilled
For my darling I love you
And I always will
Love me long
Take me to your heart
For it's there that I belong
And we'll never part
Love me dear
Tell me you are mine
I'll be yours through all the years
Till the end of time
(When at last my dreams come true
Darling this I know
Happiness will follow you
Everywhere you go)
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
"Because I love you too much, baby"
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?
We can't go on together
With suspicious minds (with suspicious minds)
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds
"So, if an old friend I know"
Stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes?
Here we go again
Asking where I've been
"You can't see the tears are real, I'm crying"
"(Yes, I'm crying)"
"Oh, let our love survive"
I'll dry the tears from your eyes
Let's don't let a good thing die
"When, honey, you know I've never lied to you"
Why can't you see
What you're doing to me
When you don't believe a word I say?
"Well, don't you know I'm caught in a trap?"
"Because I love you too much, baby..."
"I said I've made up my mind, yes I did"
To live in memory
"Of such an lone-, lonely time"
And I can't stop wanting you
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
Stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never learned to read or write so well
But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell
"Go, go, go Johnny go, go, go Johnny, go go"
"Go Johnny go, go, go Johnny go go"
Johnny B. Goode
"His mama told him ""someday you will be a man"
And you will be the leader of a big band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear your playing music when the sun goes down
"Maybe someday you will be in lights saying Johnny B. Goode"""
This hour of love we share
There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
"Three to get ready, now go, cat, go"
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
"Well, you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes"
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
You ain't nothing but a hound dog
Crying all the time
"Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit"
And you ain't no friend of mine
When they said you was high classed
"Well, that was just a lie"
You ain't never caught a rabbit
And you ain't no friend of mine
"Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit"
Ahhhhhhhhhh (ahhhh)
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
Wise men say only fools rush in
Shall I stay? Would it be a sin?
If I can't help falling in love with you
"Take my hand, take my whole life, too"
"I said see, see, see rider"
"Oh, see what you have done"
"Oh girl, you made me love you"
"Well, I've got a woman"
Way cross town
"She's good to me oh, yeah"
Say. I've got a woman
Way cross town
"She's good to me oh, yeah"
She's here in the morning
Loving me
"Yeah, she's a kind of friend to me"
She says she love me early in the morning
Just for me
"Oh, yeah you know she loves me"
"Oh, naturally"
She's there to love me both day and night
"No groans or fusses, treats me right"
Never running in the street
Loving me alone
She knows a woman's place is around home at night
"Well, she's my baby"
And I'm her loving man
"Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen sing it with us everybody. Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, right half a staff. Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, take it up one more half now. Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, AAAmen"
Treat me like a fool
Treat me mean and cruel
But love me
Wring my faithful heart
Tear it all apart
But love me (won't you love me)
"Well, if you ever go"
"Darling, I'll be oh, so lonely"
I'll be sad and blue
"Crying over you, dear only"
I would beg and steal (beg and steal)
Just to feel (just to feel)
Your heart (I want your heart)
Beating close to mine (so close to mine)
"Well, if you ever go"
I would beg and steal (he would beg and steal)
"Just to feel (yes, just to feel)"
Beggin' on my knees
"All I ask is please, please love me"
I’ve been travelling night and day
I've been running all the way
"Baby, trying to get to you"
Ever since I read your letter
I've been travelling night and day
I’ve been running all the way
I found my thrill on blueberry hill
On blueberry hill when I found you
The moon stood still on blueberry hill
And lingered until my dreams came true
I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind
Of such an old lonesome time
I can't stop wanting you
It's useless to say
That we once knew
Heals a broken heart
"Lord, help me walk another mile, just one more mile"
I'm tired of walking all alone
"Lord, help me smile another smile, just one more smile"
You know I just can't make it on my own
I never thought I needed help before
"I thought that I could get by, by myself"
But now I know I just can't take it any more
"With a humble heart, on bended knee"
"I'm begging You, please, help me"
"Come down from your golden throne to me, to lowly me"
I need to feel the touch of Your tender hand
"Remove the chains of darkness let me see, Lord let me see"
Just where I fit into Your master plan
I never thought I needed help before
"I thought that I could get by, by myself"
"Look away, look away, look away Dixieland"
"Oh I wish I was in Dixie, away, away"
Wherever you go
Wherever you may wonder in your life
"Well surely you know, I always wanna be there"
Holding your hand
And standing by to catch you when you fall
"Seeing you through, in everything you do"
I said let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
Let me take you to that wonderland that only two can share
"All I ask you, is let me be there"
Watching you grow
And going through the changes in your life
"That's how I know, I always wanna to be there"
Whenever you feel you need a friend to lean on
Here I am
"Whenever you call, you know I'll be there"
Let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
All I ask you is let me be there
Yes my baby left me
Never said a word
Was it something I done
Something that she heard?
My baby left me
My baby left me
My baby even left me
Never said a word
Now I stand at my window
Wring my hands and cry
I hate to lose that woman
Hate to say goodbye
You know she left me
"Yes, she left me"
"Baby, one of these mornings"
"Lord, it won't be long"
You'll look for me and
"Baby, and daddy he'll be gone"
Surely to the sea
"Darling, so it goes"
Some things are meant to be
Just look right in my face
I was born standing up
My daddy was a green-eyed mountain jack
"Because I'm evil, my middle name is misery"
"Well I'm evil, so don't you mess around with me"
"Because I'm evil, my middle name is misery"
"Well I'm evil, so don't you mess around with me"
"I'm evil, evil, evil, as can be"
"I'm evil, I'm evil, evil, evil"
Left my mama a goodbye note
For the next three weeks I went huntin' them nights
Just lookin' for a place to play
"Well, I thought my pickin' would set 'em on fire"
"Well, I nearly 'bout starved to death down in Memphis"
I run outta money and luck
Started pickin' out some o' them all night bars
Hopin' I could make myself a dollar
Makin' music on my guitar
There ain't no room around here for a guitar man
A little four-piece band was jammin'
I showed 'em what a band would sound like
With a swingin' little guitar man
"Show 'em, son"
Diggin' the finest little five-piece group
Guess who's leadin' that five-piece band
"Well, wouldn't ya know, it's that swingin' little guitar man"
"Play ""Trouble/Guitar Man"""
